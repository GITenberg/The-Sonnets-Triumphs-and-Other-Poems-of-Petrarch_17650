<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The present translation of Petrarch completes the Illustrated Library
series of the Italian Poets emphatically distinguished as "I Quattro
Poeti Italiani."</p>

<p>It is rather a singular fact that, while the other three Poets of this
world-famed series&mdash;Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso&mdash;have each found several
translators, no complete version of the fourth, and in Italy the most
popular, has hitherto been presented to the English reader. This lacune
becomes the more remarkable when we consider the great influence which
Petrarch has undoubtedly exercised on our poetry from the time of
Chaucer downwards.</p>

<p>The plan of the present volume has been to select from all the known
versions those most distinguished for fidelity and rhythm. Of the more
favourite poems, as many as three or four are occasionally given; while
of others, and those by no means few, it has been difficult to find even
one. Indeed, many must have remained entirely unrepresented but for the
spirited efforts of Major Macgregor, who has recently translated nearly
the whole, and that with great closeness both as to matter and form. To
this gentleman we have to return our especial thanks for his liberal
permission to make free use of his labours.</p>

<p>Among the translators will be found Chaucer, Spenser, Sir Thomas Wyatt,
Anna Hume, Sir John Harington,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> Basil Kennett, Anne Bannerman, Drummond
of Hawthornden, R. Molesworth, Hugh Boyd, Lord Woodhouselee, the Rev.
Francis Wrangham, the Rev. Dr. Nott, Dr. Morehead, Lady Dacre, Lord
Charlemont, Capel Lofft, John Penn, Charlotte Smith, Mrs. Wrottesley,
Miss Wollaston, J.H. Merivale, the Rev. W. Shepherd, and Leigh Hunt,
besides many anonymous.</p>

<p>The order of arrangement is that adopted by Marsand and other recent
editors; but to prevent any difficulty in identification, the Italian
first lines have been given throughout, and repeated in an alphabetical
index.</p>

<p>The Life of Petrarch prefixed is a condensation of the poet Campbell's
two octavo volumes, and includes all the material part of that work.</p>

<h2>THE LIFE OF PETRARCH.</h2>


<p>The family of Petrarch was originally of Florence, where his ancestors
held employments of trust and honour. Garzo, his great-grandfather, was
a notary universally respected for his integrity and judgment. Though he
had never devoted himself exclusively to letters, his literary opinion
was consulted by men of learning. He lived to be a hundred and four
years old, and died, like Plato, in the same bed in which he had been
born.</p>

<p>Garzo left three sons, one of whom was the grandfather of Petrarch.
Diminutives being customary to the Tuscan tongue, Pietro, the poet's
father, was familiarly called Petracco, or little Peter. He, like his
ancestors, was a notary, and not undistinguished for sagacity. He had
several important commissions from government. At last, in the
increasing conflicts between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines&mdash;or, as
they now called themselves, the Blacks and the Whites&mdash;Petracco, like
Dante, was obliged to fly from his native city, along with the other
Florentines of the White party. He was unjustly accused of having
officially issued a false deed, and was condemned, on the 20th of
October, 1302, to pay a fine of one thousand lire, and to have his hand
cut off, if that sum was not paid within ten days from the time he
should be apprehended. Petracco fled, taking with him his wife, Eletta
Canigiani, a lady of a distinguished family in Florence, several of whom
had held the office of Gonfalonier.</p>

<p>Petracco and his wife first settled at Arezzo, a very ancient city of
Tuscany. Hostilities did not cease between the Florentine factions till
some years afterwards; and, in an attempt made by the Whites to take
Florence by assault, Petracco was present with his party. They were
repulsed. This action, which was fatal to their cause, took place in the
night between the 19th and 20th days of July, 1304,&mdash;the precise date of
the birth of Petrarch.</p>

<p>During our poet's infancy, his family had still to struggle with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> an
adverse fate; for his proscribed and wandering father was obliged to
separate himself from his wife and child, in order to have the means of
supporting them.</p>

<p>As the pretext for banishing Petracco was purely personal, Eletta, his
wife, was not included in the sentence. She removed to a small property
of her husband's, at Ancisa, fourteen miles from Florence, and took the
little poet along with her, in the seventh month of his age. In their
passage thither, both mother and child, together with their guide, had a
narrow escape from being drowned in the Arno. Eletta entrusted her
precious charge to a robust peasant, who, for fear of hurting the child,
wrapt it in a swaddling cloth, and suspended it over his shoulder, in
the same manner as Metabus is described by Virgil, in the eleventh book
of the &AElig;neid, to have carried his daughter Camilla. In passing the
river, the horse of the guide, who carried Petrarch, stumbled, and sank
down; and in their struggles to save him, both his sturdy bearer and the
frantic parent were, like the infant itself, on the point of being
drowned.</p>

<p>After Eletta had settled at Ancisa, Petracco often visited her by
stealth, and the pledges of their affection were two other sons, one of
whom died in childhood. The other, called Gherardo, was educated along
with Petrarch. Petrarch remained with his mother at Ancisa for seven
years.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Emperor, Henry VII., in Italy, revived the hopes of
the banished Florentines; and Petracco, in order to wait the event, went
to Pisa, whither he brought his wife and Francesco, who was now in his
eighth year. Petracco remained with his family in Pisa for several
months; but tired at last of fallacious hopes, and not daring to trust
himself to the promises of the popular party, who offered to recall him
to Florence, he sought an asylum in Avignon, a place to which many
Italians were allured by the hopes of honours and gain at the papal
residence. In this voyage, Petracco and his family were nearly
shipwrecked off Marseilles.</p>

<p>But the numbers that crowded to Avignon, and its luxurious court,
rendered that city an uncomfortable place for a family in slender
circumstances. Petracco accordingly removed his household, in 1315, to
Carpentras, a small quiet town, where living was cheaper than at
Avignon. There, under the care of his mother, Petrarch imbibed his first
instruction, and was taught by one Convennole da Prato as much grammar
and logic as could be learned at his age, and more than could be learned
by an ordinary disciple from so common-place a preceptor. This poor
master, however, had sufficient intelligence to appreciate the genius of
Petrarch, whom he esteemed and honoured beyond all his other pupils. On
the other hand, his illustrious scholar aided him, in his old age and
poverty, out of his scanty income.</p>

<p>Petrarch used to compare Convennole to a whetstone, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> blunt
itself, but which sharpens others. His old master, however was sharp
enough to overreach him in the matter of borrowing and lending. When the
poet had collected a considerable library, Convennole paid him a visit,
and, pretending to be engaged in something that required him to consult
Cicero, borrowed a copy of one of the works of that orator, which was
particularly valuable. He made excuses, from time to time, for not
returning it; but Petrarch, at last, had too good reason to suspect that
the old grammarian had pawned it. The poet would willingly have paid for
redeeming it, but Convennole was so much ashamed, that he would not tell
to whom it was pawned; and the precious manuscript was lost.</p>

<p>Petracco contracted an intimacy with Settimo, a Genoese, who was like
himself, an exile for his political principles, and who fixed his abode
at Avignon with his wife and his boy, Guido Settimo, who was about the
same age with Petrarch. The two youths formed a friendship, which
subsisted between them for life.</p>

<p>Petrarch manifested signs of extraordinary sensibility to the charms of
nature in his childhood, both when he was at Carpentras and at Avignon.
One day, when he was at the latter residence, a party was made up, to
see the fountain of Vaucluse, a few leagues from Avignon. The little
Francesco had no sooner arrived at the lovely landscape than he was
struck with its beauties, and exclaimed, "Here, now, is a retirement
suited to my taste, and preferable, in my eyes, to the greatest and most
splendid cities."</p>

<p>A genius so fine as that of our poet could not servilely confine itself
to the slow method of school learning, adapted to the intellects of
ordinary boys. Accordingly, while his fellow pupils were still plodding
through the first rudiments of Latin, Petrarch had recourse to the
original writers, from whom the grammarians drew their authority, and
particularly employed himself in perusing the works of Cicero. And,
although he was, at this time, much too young to comprehend the full
force of the orator's reasoning, he was so struck with the charms of his
style, that he considered him the only true model in prose composition.</p>

<p>His father, who was himself something of a scholar, was pleased and
astonished at this early proof of his good taste; he applauded his
classical studies, and encouraged him to persevere in them; but, very
soon, he imagined that he had cause to repent of his commendations.
Classical learning was, in that age, regarded as a mere solitary
accomplishment, and the law was the only road that led to honours and
preferment. Petracco was, therefore, desirous to turn into that channel
the brilliant qualities of his son; and for this purpose he sent him, at
the age of fifteen, to the university of Montpelier. Petrarch remained
there for four years, and attended lectures on law from some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> the
most famous professors of the science. But his prepossession for Cicero
prevented him from much frequenting the dry and dusty walks of
jurisprudence. In his epistle to posterity, he endeavours to justify
this repugnance by other motives. He represents the abuses, the
chicanery, and mercenary practices of the law, as inconsistent with
every principle of candour and honesty.</p>

<p>When Petracco observed that his son made no great progress in his legal
studies at Montpelier, he removed him, in 1323, to Bologna, celebrated
for the study of the canon and civil law, probably imagining that the
superior fame of the latter place might attract him to love the law. To
Bologna Petrarch was accompanied by his brother Gherardo, and by his
inseparable friend, young Guido Settimo.</p>

<p>But neither the abilities of the several professors in that celebrated
academy, nor the strongest exhortations of his father, were sufficient
to conquer the deeply-rooted aversion which our poet had conceived for
the law. Accordingly, Petracco hastened to Bologna, that he might
endeavour to check his son's indulgence in literature, which
disconcerted his favourite designs. Petrarch, guessing at the motive of
his arrival, hid the copies of Cicero, Virgil, and some other authors,
which composed his small library, and to purchase which he had deprived
himself of almost the necessaries of life. His father, however, soon
discovered the place of their concealment, and threw them into the fire.
Petrarch exhibited as much agony as if he had been himself the martyr of
his father's resentment. Petracco was so much affected by his son's
tears, that he rescued from the flames Cicero and Virgil, and,
presenting them to Petrarch, he said, "Virgil will console you for the
loss of your other MSS., and Cicero will prepare you for the study of
the law."</p>

<p>It is by no means wonderful that a mind like Petrarch's could but ill
relish the glosses of the Code and the commentaries on the Decretals.</p>

<p>At Bologna, however, he met with an accomplished literary man and no
inelegant poet in one of the professors, who, if he failed in persuading
Petrarch to make the law his profession, certainly quickened his relish
and ambition for poetry. This man was Cino da Pistoia, who is esteemed
by Italians as the most tender and harmonious lyric poet in the native
language anterior to Petrarch.</p>

<p>During his residence at Bologna, Petrarch made an excursion as far as
Venice, a city that struck him with enthusiastic admiration. In one of
his letters he calls it "<i>orbem alterum</i>." Whilst Italy was harassed, he
says, on all sides by continual dissensions, like the sea in a storm,
Venice alone appeared like a safe harbour, which overlooked the tempest
without feeling its commotion. The resolute and independent spirit of
that republic made an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> indelible impression on Petrarch's heart. The
young poet, perhaps, at this time little imagined that Venice was to be
the last scene of his triumphant eloquence.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from Venice to Bologna, he received the melancholy
intelligence of the death of his mother, in the thirty-eighth year of
her age. Her age is known by a copy of verses which Petrarch wrote upon
her death, the verses being the same in number as the years of her life.
She had lived humble and retired, and had devoted herself to the good of
her family; virtuous amidst the prevalence of corrupted manners, and,
though a beautiful woman, untainted by the breath of calumny. Petrarch
has repaid her maternal affection by preserving her memory from
oblivion. Petracco did not long survive the death of this excellent
woman. According to the judgment of our poet, his father was a man of
strong character and understanding. Banished from his native country,
and engaged in providing for his family, he was prevented by the
scantiness of his fortune, and the cares of his situation, from rising
to that eminence which he might have otherwise attained. But his
admiration of Cicero, in an age when that author was universally
neglected, was a proof of his superior mind.</p>

<p>Petrarch quitted Bologna upon the death of his father, and returned to
Avignon, with his brother Gherardo, to collect the shattered remains of
their father's property. Upon their arrival, they found their domestic
affairs in a state of great disorder, as the executors of Petracco's
will had betrayed the trust reposed in them, and had seized most of the
effects of which they could dispose. Under these circumstances, Petrarch
was most anxious for a MS. of Cicero, which his father had highly
prized. "The guardians," he writes, "eager to appropriate what they
esteemed the more valuable effects, had fortunately left this MS. as a
thing of no value." Thus he owed to their ignorance this treatise, which
he considered the richest portion of the inheritance left him by his
father.</p>

<p>But, that inheritance being small, and not sufficient for the
maintenance of the two brothers, they were obliged to think of some
profession for their subsistence; they therefore entered the church; and
Avignon was the place, of all others, where preferment was most easily
obtained. John XXII. had fixed his residence entirely in that city since
October, 1316, and had appropriated to himself the nomination to all the
vacant benefices. The pretence for this appropriation was to prevent
simony&mdash;in others, not in his Holiness&mdash;as the sale of benefices was
carried by him to an enormous height. At every promotion to a bishopric,
he removed other bishops; and, by the meanest impositions, soon amassed
prodigious wealth. Scandalous emoluments, also, which arose from the
sale of indulgences, were enlarged, if not invented, under his papacy,
and every method of acquiring riches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> was justified which could
contribute to feed his avarice. By these sordid means, he collected such
sums, that, according to Villani, he left behind him, <i>in the sacred
treasury</i>, twenty-five millions of florins, a treasure which Voltaire
remarks is hardly credible.</p>

<p>The luxury and corruption which reigned in the Roman court at Avignon
are fully displayed in some letters of Petrarch's, without either date
or address. The partizans of that court, it is true, accuse him of
prejudice and exaggeration. He painted, as they allege, the popes and
cardinals in the gloomiest colouring. His letters contain the blackest
catalogue of crimes that ever disgraced humanity.</p>

<p>Petrarch was twenty-two years of age when he settled at Avignon, a scene
of licentiousness and profligacy. The luxury of the cardinals, and the
pomp and riches of the papal court, were displayed in an extravagant
profusion of feasts and ceremonies, which attracted to Avignon women of
all ranks, among whom intrigue and gallantry were generally
countenanced. Petrarch was by nature of a warm temperament, with vivid
and susceptible passions, and strongly attached to the fair sex. We must
not therefore be surprised if, with these dispositions, and in such a
dissolute city, he was betrayed into some excesses. But these were the
result of his complexion, and not of deliberate profligacy. He alludes
to this subject in his Epistle to Posterity, with every appearance of
truth and candour.</p>

<p>From his own confession, Petrarch seems to have been somewhat vain of
his personal appearance during his youth, a venial foible, from which
neither the handsome nor the homely, nor the wise nor the foolish, are
exempt. It is amusing to find our own Milton betraying this weakness, in
spite of all the surrounding strength of his character. In answering one
of his slanderers, who had called him pale and cadaverous, the author of
Paradise Lost appeals to all who knew him whether his complexion was not
so fresh and blooming as to make him appear ten years younger than he
really was.</p>

<p>Petrarch, when young, was so strikingly handsome, that he was frequently
pointed at and admired as he passed along, for his features were manly,
well-formed, and expressive, and his carriage was graceful and
distinguished. He was sprightly in conversation, and his voice was
uncommonly musical. His complexion was between brown and fair, and his
eyes were bright and animated. His countenance was a faithful index of
his heart.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to temper the warmth of his constitution by the
regularity of his living and the plainness of his diet. He indulged
little in either wine or sleep, and fed chiefly on fruits and
vegetables.</p>

<p>In his early days he was nice and neat in his dress, even to a degree of
affectation, which, in later life, he ridiculed when writing to his
brother Gherardo. "Do you remember," he says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> "how much care we
employed in the lure of dressing our persons; when we traversed the
streets, with what attention did we not avoid every breath of wind which
might discompose our hair; and with what caution did we not prevent the
least speck of dirt from soiling our garments!"</p>

<p>This vanity, however, lasted only during his youthful days. And even
then neither attention to his personal appearance, nor his attachment to
the fair sex, nor his attendance upon the great, could induce Petrarch
to neglect his own mental improvement, for, amidst all these
occupations, he found leisure for application, and devoted himself to
the cultivation of his favourite pursuits of literature.</p>

<p>Inclined by nature to moral philosophy, he was guided by the reading of
Cicero and Seneca to that profound knowledge of the human heart, of the
duties of others and of our own duties, which shows itself in all his
writings. Gifted with a mind full of enthusiasm for poetry, he learned
from Virgil elegance and dignity in versification. But he had still
higher advantages from the perusal of Livy. The magnanimous actions of
Roman heroes so much excited the soul of Petrarch, that he thought the
men of his own age light and contemptible.</p>

<p>His first compositions were in Latin: many motives, however, induced him
to compose in the vulgar tongue, as Italian was then called, which,
though improved by Dante, was still, in many respects, harsh and
inelegant, and much in want of new beauties. Petrarch wrote for the
living, and for that portion of the living who were least of all to be
fascinated by the language of the dead. Latin might be all very well for
inscriptions on mausoleums, but it was not suited for the ears of beauty
and the bowers of love. The Italian language acquired, under his
cultivation, increased elegance and richness, so that the harmony of his
style has contributed to its beauty. He did not, however, attach himself
solely to Italian, but composed much in Latin, which he reserved for
graver, or, as he considered, more important subjects. His compositions
in Latin are&mdash;Africa, an epic poem; his Bucolics, containing twelve
eclogues; and three books of epistles.</p>

<p>Petrarch's greatest obstacles to improvement arose from the scarcity of
authors whom he wished to consult&mdash;for the manuscripts of the writers of
the Augustan age were, at that time, so uncommon, that many could not be
procured, and many more of them could not be purchased under the most
extravagant price. This scarcity of books had checked the dawning light
of literature. The zeal of our poet, however, surmounted all these
obstacles, for he was indefatigable in collecting and copying many of
the choicest manuscripts; and posterity is indebted to him for the
possession of many valuable writings, which were in danger of being lost
through the carelessness or ignorance of the possessors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrarch could not but perceive the superiority of his own understanding
and the brilliancy of his abilities. The modest humility which knows not
its own worth is not wont to show itself in minds much above mediocrity;
and to elevated geniuses this virtue is a stranger. Petrarch from his
youthful age had an internal assurance that he should prove worthy of
estimation and honours. Nevertheless, as he advanced in the field of
science, he saw the prospect increase, Alps over Alps, and seemed to be
lost amidst the immensity of objects before him. Hence the anticipation
of immeasurable labours occasionally damped his application. But from
this depression of spirits he was much relieved by the encouragement of
John of Florence, one of the secretaries of the Pope, a man of learning
and probity. He soon distinguished the extraordinary abilities of
Petrarch; he directed him in his studies, and cheered up his ambition.
Petrarch returned his affection with unbounded confidence. He entrusted
him with all his foibles, his disgusts, and his uneasinesses. He says
that he never conversed with him without finding himself more calm and
composed, and more animated for study.</p>

<p>The superior sagacity of our poet, together with his pleasing manners,
and his increasing reputation for knowledge, ensured to him the most
flattering prospects of success. His conversation was courted by men of
rank, and his acquaintance was sought by men of learning. It was at this
time, 1326, that his merit procured him the friendship and patronage of
James Colonna, who belonged to one of the most ancient and illustrious
families of Italy.</p>

<p>"About the twenty-second year of my life," Petrarch writes to one of his
friends, "I became acquainted with James Colonna. He had seen me whilst
I resided at Bologna, and was prepossessed, as he was pleased to say,
with my appearance. Upon his arrival at Avignon, he again saw me, when,
having inquired minutely into the state of my affairs, he admitted me to
his friendship. I cannot sufficiently describe the cheerfulness of his
temper, his social disposition, his moderation in prosperity, his
constancy in adversity. I speak not from report, but from my own
experience. He was endowed with a persuasive and forcible eloquence. His
conversation and letters displayed the amiableness of his sincere
character. He gained the first place in my affections, which he ever
afterwards retained."</p>

<p>Such is the portrait which our poet gives of James Colonna. A faithful
and wise friend is among the most precious gifts of fortune; but, as
friendships cannot wholly feed our affections, the heart of Petrarch, at
this ardent age, was destined to be swayed by still tenderer feelings.
He had nearly finished his twenty-third year without having ever
seriously known the passion of love. In that year he first saw Laura.
Concerning this lady, at one time, when no life of Petrarch had been yet
written that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> not crude and inaccurate, his biographers launched
into the wildest speculations. One author considered her as an
allegorical being; another discovered her to be a type of the Virgin
Mary; another thought her an allegory of poetry and repentance. Some
denied her even allegorical existence, and deemed her a mere phantom
beauty, with which the poet had fallen in love, like Pygmalion with the
work of his own creation. All these caprices about Laura's history have
been long since dissipated, though the principal facts respecting her
were never distinctly verified, till De Sade, her own descendant, wrote
his memoirs of the Life of Petrarch.</p>

<p>Petrarch himself relates that in 1327, exactly at the first hour of the
6th of April, he first beheld Laura in the church of St. Clara of
Avignon,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> where neither the sacredness of the place, nor the solemnity
of the day, could prevent him from being smitten for life with human
love. In that fatal hour he saw a lady, a little younger than himself<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
in a green mantle sprinkled with violets, on which her golden hair fell
plaited in tresses. She was distinguished from all others by her proud
and delicate carriage. The impression which she made on his heart was
sudden, yet it was never effaced.</p>

<p>Laura, descended from a family of ancient and noble extraction, was the
daughter of Audibert de Noves, a Proven&ccedil;al nobleman, by his wife
Esmessenda. She was born at Avignon, probably in 1308. She had a
considerable fortune, and was married in 1325 to Hugh de Sade. The
particulars of her life are little known, as Petrarch has left few
traces of them in his letters; and it was still less likely that he
should enter upon her personal history in his sonnets, which, as they
were principally addressed to herself, made it unnecessary for him to
inform her of what she already knew.</p>

<p>While many writers have erred in considering Petrarch's attachment as
visionary, others, who have allowed the reality of his passion, have
been mistaken in their opinion of its object. They allege that Petrarch
was a happy lover, and that his mistress was accustomed to meet him at
Vaucluse, and make him a full compensation for his fondness. No one at
all acquainted with the life and writings of Petrarch will need to be
told that this is an absurd fiction. Laura, a married woman, who bore
ten children to a rather morose husband, could not have gone to meet him
at Vaucluse without the most flagrant scandal. It is evident from his
writings that she repudiated his passion whenever it threatened to
exceed the limits of virtuous friendship. On one occasion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> when he
seemed to presume too far upon her favour, she said to him with
severity, "I am not what you take me for." If his love had been
successful, he would have said less about it.</p>

<p>Of the two persons in this love affair, I am more inclined to pity Laura
than Petrarch. Independently of her personal charms, I cannot conceive
Laura otherwise than as a kind-hearted, loveable woman, who could not
well be supposed to be totally indifferent to the devotion of the most
famous and fascinating man of his age. On the other hand, what was the
penalty that she would have paid if she had encouraged his addresses as
far as he would have carried them? Her disgrace, a stigma left on her
family, and the loss of all that character which upholds a woman in her
own estimation and in that of the world. I would not go so far as to say
that she did not at times betray an anxiety to retain him under the
spell of her fascination, as, for instance, when she is said to have
cast her eyes to the ground in sadness when he announced his intention
to leave Avignon; but still I should like to hear her own explanation
before I condemned her. And, after all, she was only anxious for the
continuance of attentions, respecting which she had made a fixed
understanding that they should not exceed the bounds of innocence.</p>

<p>We have no distinct account how her husband regarded the homage of
Petrarch to his wife&mdash;whether it flattered his vanity, or moved his
wrath. As tradition gives him no very good character for temper, the
latter supposition is the more probable. Every morning that he went out
he might hear from some kind friend the praises of a new sonnet which
Petrarch had written on his wife; and, when he came back to dinner, of
course his good humour was not improved by the intelligence. He was in
the habit of scolding her till she wept; he married seven months after
her death, and, from all that is known of him, appears to have been a
bad husband. I suspect that Laura paid dearly for her poet's idolatry.</p>

<p>No incidents of Petrarch's life have been transmitted to us for the
first year or two after his attachment to Laura commenced. He seems to
have continued at Avignon, prosecuting his studies and feeding his
passion.</p>

<p>James Colonna, his friend and patron, was promoted in 1328 to the
bishopric of Lombes in Gascony; and in the year 1330 he went from
Avignon to take possession of his diocese, and invited Petrarch to
accompany him to his residence. No invitation could be more acceptable
to our poet: they set out at the end of March, 1330. In order to reach
Lombes, it was necessary to cross the whole of Languedoc, and to pass
through Montpelier, Narbonne, and Toulouse. Petrarch already knew
Montpelier, where he had, or ought to have, studied the law for four
years.</p>

<p>Full of enthusiasm for Rome, Petrarch was rejoiced to find at Narbonne
the city which had been the first Roman colony planted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> among the Gauls.
This colony had been formed entirely of Roman citizens, and, in order to
reconcile them to their exile, the city was built like a little image of
Rome. It had its capital, its baths, arches, and fountains; all which
works were worthy of the Roman name. In passing through Narbonne,
Petrarch discovered a number of ancient monuments and inscriptions.</p>

<p>Our travellers thence proceeded to Toulouse, where they passed several
days. This city, which was known even before the foundation of Rome, is
called, in some ancient Roman acts, "Roma Garumn&aelig;." It was famous in the
classical ages for cultivating literature. After the fall of the Roman
empire, the successive incursions of the Visigoths, the Saracens, and
the Normans, for a long time silenced the Muses at Toulouse; but they
returned to their favourite haunt after ages of barbarism had passed
away. De Sade says, that what is termed Proven&ccedil;al poetry was much more
cultivated by the Languedocians than by the Proven&ccedil;als, properly so
called. The city of Toulouse was considered as the principal seat of
this earliest modern poetry, which was carried to perfection in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, under the patronage of the Counts of
Toulouse, particularly Raimond V., and his son, Raimond VI. Petrarch
speaks with high praise of those poets in his Triumphs of Love. It has
been alleged that he owed them this mark of his regard for their having
been so useful to him in his Italian poetry; and Nostradamus even
accuses him of having stolen much from them. But Tassoni, who understood
the Proven&ccedil;al poets better than Nostradamus, defends him successfully
from this absurd accusation.</p>

<p>Although Proven&ccedil;al poetry was a little on its decline since the days of
the Dukes of Aquitaine and the Counts of Toulouse, it was still held in
honour; and, when Petrarch arrived, the Floral games had been
established at Toulouse during six years.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Ere long, however, our travellers found less agreeable objects of
curiosity, that formed a sad contrast with the chivalric manners, the
floral games, and the gay poetry of southern France. Bishop Colonna and
Petrarch had intended to remain for some time at Toulouse; but their
sojourn was abridged by their horror at a tragic event<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> in the
principal monastery of the place. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> lived in that monastery a young
monk, named Augustin, who was expert in music, and accompanied the
psalmody of the religious brothers with beautiful touches on the organ.
The superior of the convent, relaxing its discipline, permitted Augustin
frequently to mix with the world, in order to teach music, and to
improve himself in the art. The young monk was in the habit of
familiarly visiting the house of a respectable citizen: he was
frequently in the society of his daughter, and, by the express
encouragement of her father, undertook to exercise her in the practice
of music. Another young man, who was in love with the girl, grew jealous
of the monk, who was allowed to converse so familiarly with her, whilst
he, her lay admirer, could only have stolen glimpses of her as she
passed to church or to public spectacles. He set about the ruin of his
supposed rival with cunning atrocity; and, finding that the young woman
was infirm in health, suborned a physician, as worthless as himself, to
declare that she was pregnant. Her credulous father, without inquiring
whether the intelligence was true or false, went to the superior of the
convent, and accused Augustin, who, though thunderstruck at the
accusation, denied it firmly, and defended himself intrepidly. But the
superior was deaf to his plea of innocence, and ordered him to be shut
up in his cell, that he might await his punishment. Thither the poor
young man was conducted, and threw himself on his bed in a state of
horror.</p>

<p>The superior and the elders among the friars thought it a meet fate for
the accused that he should be buried alive in a subterranean dungeon,
after receiving the terrific sentence of "<i>Vade in pace</i>." At the end of
several days the victim dashed out his brains against the walls of his
sepulchre. Bishop Colonna, who, it would appear, had no power to oppose
this hideous transaction, when he was informed of it, determined to
leave the place immediately; and Petrarch in his indignation exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Heu! fuge crudeles terras, fuge littus avarum."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Virg.</span></p></div>

<p>On the 26th of May, 1330, the Bishop of Lombes and Petrarch quitted
Toulouse, and arrived at the mansion of the diocese. Lombes&mdash;in Latin,
Lombarium&mdash;lies at the foot of the Pyrenees, only eight leagues from
Toulouse. It is small and ill-built, and offers no allurement to the
curiosity of the traveller. Till lately it had been a simple abbey of
the Augustine monks. The whole of the clergy of the little city, singing
psalms, issued out of Lombes to meet their new pastor, who, under a rich
canopy, was conducted to the principal church, and there, in his
episcopal robes, blessed the people, and delivered an eloquent
discourse. Petrarch beheld with admiration the dignified behaviour of
the youthful prelate. James Colonna, though accustomed to the wealth and
luxury of Rome, came to the Pyrenean rocks with a pleased countenance.
"His aspect," says Petrarch, "made it seem as if Italy had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
transported into Gascony." Nothing is more beautiful than the patient
endurance of our destiny; yet there are many priests who would suffer
translation to a well-paid, though mountainous bishopric, with patience
and piety.</p>

<p>The vicinity of the Pyrenees renders the climate of Lombes very severe;
and the character and conversation of the inhabitants were scarcely more
genial than their climate. But Petrarch found in the bishop's abode
friends who consoled him in this exile among the Lombesians. Two young
and familiar inmates of the Bishop's house attracted and returned his
attachment. The first of these was Lello di Stefani, a youth of a noble
and ancient family in Rome, long attached to the Colonnas. Lello's
gifted understanding was improved by study; so Petrarch tells us; and he
could have been no ordinary man whom our accomplished poet so highly
valued. In his youth he had quitted his studies for the profession of
arms; but the return of peace restored him to his literary pursuits.
Such was the attachment between Petrarch and Lello, that Petrarch gave
him the name of L&aelig;lius, the most attached companion of Scipio. The other
friend to whom Petrarch attached himself in the house of James Colonna
was a young German, extremely accomplished in music. De Sade says that
his name was Louis, without mentioning his cognomen. He was a native of
Ham, near Bois le Duc, on the left bank of the Rhine between Brabant and
Holland. Petrarch, with his Italian prejudices, regarded him as a
barbarian by birth; but he was so fascinated by his serene temper and
strong judgment, that he singled him out to be the chief of all his
friends, and gave him the name of Socrates, noting him as an example
that Nature can sometimes produce geniuses in the most unpropitious
regions.</p>

<p>After having passed the summer of 1330 at Lombes, the Bishop returned to
Avignon, in order to meet his father, the elder Stefano Colonna, and his
brother the Cardinal.</p>

<p>The Colonnas were a family of the first distinction in modern Italy.
They had been exceedingly powerful during the popedom of Boniface VIII.,
through the talents of the late Cardinal James Colonna, brother of the
famous old Stefano, so well known to Petrarch, and whom he used to call
a ph&oelig;nix sprung up from the ashes of Rome. Their house possessed also
an influential public character in the Cardinal Pietro, brother of the
younger Stefano. They were formidable from the territories and castles
which they possessed, and by their alliance and friendship with Charles,
King of Naples. The power of the Colonna family became offensive to
Boniface, who, besides, hated the two Cardinals for having opposed the
renunciation of Celestine V., which Boniface had fraudulently obtained.
Boniface procured a crusade against them. They were beaten, expelled
from their castles, and almost exterminated; they implored peace, but in
vain; they were driven from Rome, and obliged to seek refuge, some in
Sicily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> and others in France. During the time of their exile, Boniface
proclaimed it a capital crime to give shelter to any of them.</p>

<p>The Colonnas finally returned to their dignities and property, and
afterwards made successful war against the house of their rivals, the
Orsini.</p>

<p>John Colonna, the Cardinal, brother of the Bishop of Lombes, and son of
old Stefano, was one of the very ablest men at the papal court. He
insisted on our poet taking up his abode in his own palace at Avignon.
"What good fortune was this for me!" says Petrarch. "This great man
never made me feel that he was my superior in station. He was like a
father or an indulgent brother; and I lived in his house as if it had
been my own." At a subsequent period, we find him on somewhat cooler
terms with John Colonna, and complaining that his domestic dependence
had, by length of time, become wearisome to him. But great allowance is
to be made for such apparent inconsistencies in human attachment. At
different times our feelings and language on any subject may be
different without being insincere. The truth seems to be that Petrarch
looked forward to the friendship of the Colonnas for promotion, which he
either received scantily, or not at all; so it is little marvellous if
he should have at last felt the tedium of patronage.</p>

<p>For the present, however, this home was completely to Petrarch's taste.
It was the rendezvous of all strangers distinguished by their knowledge
and talents, whom the papal court attracted to Avignon, which was now
the great centre of all political negotiations.</p>

<p>This assemblage of the learned had a powerful influence on Petrarch's
fine imagination. He had been engaged for some time in the perusal of
Livy, and his enthusiasm for ancient Rome was heightened, if possible,
by the conversation of old Stefano Colonna, who dwelt on no subject with
so much interest as on the temples and palaces of the ancient city,
majestic even in their ruins.</p>

<p>During the bitter persecution raised against his family by Boniface
VIII., Stefano Colonna had been the chief object of the Pope's
implacable resentment. Though oppressed by the most adverse
circumstances, his estates confiscated, his palaces levelled with the
ground, and himself driven into exile, the majesty of his appearance,
and the magnanimity of his character, attracted the respect of strangers
wherever he went. He had the air of a sovereign prince rather than of an
exile, and commanded more regard than monarchs in the height of their
ostentation.</p>

<p>In the picture of his times, Stefano makes a noble and commanding
figure. If the reader, however, happens to search into that period of
Italian history, he will find many facts to cool the romance of his
imagination respecting all the Colonna family. They were, in plain
truth, an oppressive aristocratic family. The portion of Italy which
they and their tyrannical rivals possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> was infamously governed. The
highways were rendered impassable by banditti, who were in the pay of
contesting feudal lords; and life and property were everywhere insecure.</p>

<p>Stefano, nevertheless, seems to have been a man formed for better times.
He improved in the school of misfortune&mdash;the serenity of his temper
remained unclouded by adversity, and his faculties unimpaired by age.</p>

<p>Among the illustrious strangers who came to Avignon at this time was our
countryman, Richard de Bury, then accounted the most learned man of
England. He arrived at Avignon in 1331, having been sent to the Pope by
Edward III. De Sade conceives that the object of his embassy was to
justify his sovereign before the Pontiff for having confined the
Queen-mother in the castle of Risings, and for having caused her
favourite, Roger de Mortimer, to be hanged. It was a matter of course
that so illustrious a stranger as Richard de Bury should be received
with distinction by Cardinal Colonna. Petrarch eagerly seized the
opportunity of forming his acquaintance, confident that De Bury could
give him valuable information on many points of geography and history.
They had several conversations. Petrarch tells us that he entreated the
learned Englishman to make him acquainted with the true situation of the
isle of Thule, of which the ancients speak with much uncertainty, but
which their best geographers place at the distance of some days'
navigation from the north of England. De Bury was, in all probability,
puzzled with the question, though he did not like to confess his
ignorance. He excused himself by promising to inquire into the subject
as soon as he should get back to his books in England, and to write to
him the best information he could afford. It does not appear, however,
that he performed his promise.</p>

<p>De Bury's stay at the court of Avignon was very short. King Edward, it
is true, sent him a second time to the Pope, two years afterwards, on
important business. The seeds of discord between France and England
began to germinate strongly, and that circumstance probably occasioned
De Bury's second mission. Unfortunately, however, Petrarch could not
avail himself of his return so as to have further interviews with the
English scholar. Petrarch wrote repeatedly to De Bury for his promised
explanations respecting Thule; but, whether our countryman had found
nothing in his library to satisfy his inquiries, or was prevented by his
public occupations, there is no appearance of his having ever answered
Petrarch's letters.</p>

<p>Stephano Colonna the younger had brought with him to Avignon his son
Agapito, who was destined for the church, that he might be educated
under the eyes of the Cardinal and the Bishop, who were his uncles.
These two prelates joined with their father in entreating Petrarch to
undertake the superintendence of Agapito's studies. Our poet, avaricious
of his time, and jealous of his inde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>pendence, was at first reluctant to
undertake the charge; but, from his attachment to the family, at last
accepted it. De Sade tells us that Petrarch was not successful in the
young man's education; and, from a natural partiality for the hero of
his biography, lays the blame on his pupil. At the same time he
acknowledges that a man with poetry in his head and love in his heart
was not the most proper mentor in the world for a youth who was to be
educated for the church. At this time, Petrarch's passion for Laura
continued to haunt his peace with incessant violence. She had received
him at first with good-humour and affability; but it was only while he
set strict bounds to the expression of his attachment. He had not,
however, sufficient self-command to comply with these terms. His
constant assiduities, his eyes continually riveted upon her, and the
wildness of his looks, convinced her of his inordinate attachment; her
virtue took alarm; she retired whenever he approached her, and even
covered her face with a veil whilst he was present, nor would she
condescend to the slightest action or look that might seem to
countenance his passion.</p>

<p>Petrarch complains of these severities in many of his melancholy
sonnets. Meanwhile, if fame could have been a balm to love, he might
have been happy. His reputation as a poet was increasing, and his
compositions were read with universal approbation.</p>

<p>The next interesting event in our poet's life was a larger course of
travels, which he took through the north of France, through Flanders,
Brabant, and a part of Germany, subsequently to his tour in Languedoc.
Petrarch mentions that he undertook this journey about the twenty-fifth
year of his age. He was prompted to travel not only by his curiosity to
observe men and manners, by his desire of seeing monuments of antiquity,
and his hopes of discovering the MSS. of ancient authors, but also, we
may believe, by his wish, if it were possible, to escape from himself,
and to forget Laura.</p>

<p>From Paris Petrarch wrote as follows to Cardinal Colonna. "I have
visited Paris, the capital of the whole kingdom of France. I entered it
in the same state of mind that was felt by Apuleias when he visited
Hypata, a city of Thessaly, celebrated for its magic, of which such
wonderful things were related, looking again and again at every object,
in solicitous suspense, to know whether all that he had heard of the
far-famed place was true or false. Here I pass a great deal of time in
observation, and, as the day is too short for my curiosity, I add the
night. At last, it seems to me that, by long exploring, I have enabled
myself to distinguish between the true and the false in what is related
about Paris. But, as the subject would be too tedious for this occasion,
I shall defer entering fully into particulars till I can do so <i>viv&acirc;
voce</i>. My impatience, however, impels me to sketch for you briefly a
general idea of this so celebrated city, and of the character of its
inhabitants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>"Paris, though always inferior to its fame, and much indebted to the
lies of its own people, is undoubtedly a great city. To be sure I never
saw a dirtier place, except Avignon. At the same time, its population
contains the most learned of men, and it is like a great basket in which
are collected the rarest fruits of every country. From the time that its
university was founded, as they say by Alcuin, the teacher of
Charlemagne, there has not been, to my knowledge, a single Parisian of
any fame. The great luminaries of the university were all strangers;
and, if the love of my country does not deceive me, they were chiefly
Italians, such as Pietro Lombardo, Tomaso d'Aquino, Bonaventura, and
many others.</p>

<p>"The character of the Parisians is very singular. There was a time when,
from the ferocity of their manners, the French were reckoned barbarians.
At present the case is wholly changed. A gay disposition, love of
society, ease, and playfulness in conversation now characterize them.
They seek every opportunity of distinguishing themselves; and make war
against all cares with joking, laughing, singing, eating, and drinking.
Prone, however, as they are to pleasure, they are not heroic in
adversity. The French love their country and their countrymen; they
censure with rigour the faults of other nations, but spread a
proportionably thick veil over their own defects."</p>

<p>From Paris, Petrarch proceeded to Ghent, of which only he makes mention
to the Cardinal, without noticing any of the towns that lie between. It
is curious to find our poet out of humour with Flanders on account of
the high price of wine, which was not an indigenous article. In the
latter part of his life, Petrarch was certainly one of the most
abstemious of men; but, at this period, it would seem that he drank good
liquor enough to be concerned about its price.</p>

<p>From Ghent he passed on to Liege. "This city is distinguished," he says,
"by the riches and the number of its clergy. As I had heard that
excellent MSS. might be found there, I stopped in the place for some
time. But is it not singular that in so considerable a place I had
difficulty to procure ink enough to copy two orations of Cicero's, and
the little that I could obtain was as yellow as saffron?"</p>

<p>Petrarch was received at most of the places he visited, and more
particularly at Cologne, with marks of great respect; and he was
agreeably surprised to find that his reputation had acquired him the
partiality and acquaintance of several inhabitants. He was conducted by
his new friends to the banks of the Rhine, where the inhabitants were
engaged in the performance of a superstitious annual ceremony, which,
for its singularity, deserves to be recorded.</p>

<p>"The banks of the river were crowded with a considerable number of
women, their persons comely, and their dress elegant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> This great
concourse of people seemed to create no confusion. A number of these
women, with cheerful countenances, crowned with flowers, bathed their
hands and arms in the stream, and uttered, at the same time, some
harmonious expressions in a language which I did not understand. I
inquired into the cause of this ceremony, and was informed that it arose
from a tradition among the people, and particularly among the women,
that the impending calamities of the year were carried away by this
ablution, and that blessings succeeded in their place. Hence this
ceremony is annually renewed, and the ablution performed with
unremitting diligence."</p>

<p>The ceremony being finished, Petrarch smiled at their superstition, and
exclaimed, "O happy inhabitants of the Rhine, whose waters wash out your
miseries, whilst neither the Po nor the Tiber can wash out ours! You
transmit your evils to the Britons by means of this river, whilst we
send off ours to the Illyrians and the Africans. It seems that our
rivers have a slower course."</p>

<p>Petrarch shortened his excursion that he might return the sooner to
Avignon, where the Bishop of Lombes had promised to await his return,
and take him to Rome.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Lyons, however, he was informed that the Bishop had
departed from Avignon for Rome. In the first paroxysm of his
disappointment he wrote a letter to his friend, which portrays strongly
affectionate feelings, but at the same time an irascible temper. When he
came to Avignon, the Cardinal Colonna relieved him from his irritation
by acquainting him with the real cause of his brother's departure. The
flames of civil dissension had been kindled at Rome between the rival
families of Colonna and Orsini. The latter had made great preparations
to carry on the war with vigour. In this crisis of affairs, James
Colonna had been summoned to Rome to support the interests of his
family, and, by his courage and influence, to procure them the succour
which they so much required.</p>

<p>Petrarch continued to reside at Avignon for several years after
returning from his travels in France and Flanders. It does not appear
from his sonnets, during those years, either that his passion for Laura
had abated, or that she had given him any more encouragement than
heretofore. But in the year 1334, an accident renewed the utmost
tenderness of his affections. A terrible affliction visited the city of
Avignon. The heat and the drought were so excessive that almost the
whole of the common people went about naked to the waist, and, with
frenzy and miserable cries, implored Heaven to put an end to their
calamities. Persons of both sexes and of all ages had their bodies
covered with scales, and changed their skins like serpents.</p>

<p>Laura's constitution was too delicate to resist this infectious malady,
and her illness greatly alarmed Petrarch. One day he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> asked her
physician how she was, and was told by him that her condition was very
dangerous: on that occasion he composed the following sonnet:<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This lovely spirit, if ordain'd to leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its mortal tenement before its time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's fairest habitation shall receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome her to breathe its sweetest clime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she establish her abode between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars and the planet-star of Beauty's queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun will be obscured, so dense a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spirits from adjacent stars will crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gaze upon her beauty infinite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say that she fixes on a lower sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the glorious sun, her beauty soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will dim the splendour of inferior stars&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mars, of Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'll choose not Mars, but higher place than Mars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will eclipse all planetary light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jupiter himself will seem less bright.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I trust that I have enough to say in favour of Petrarch to satisfy his
rational admirers; but I quote this sonnet as an example of the worst
style of Petrarch's poetry. I make the English reader welcome to rate my
power of translating it at the very lowest estimation. He cannot go much
further down than myself in the scale of valuation, especially if he has
Italian enough to know that the exquisite mechanical harmony of
Petrarch's style is beyond my reach. It has been alleged that this
sonnet shows how much the mind of Petrarch had been influenced by his
Platonic studies; but if Plato had written poetry he would never have
been so extravagant.</p>

<p>Petrarch, on his return from Germany, had found the old Pope, John
XXII., intent on two speculations, to both of which he lent his
enthusiastic aid. One of them was a futile attempt to renew the
crusades, from which Europe had reposed for a hundred years. The other
was the transfer of the holy seat to Rome. The execution of this plan,
for which Petrarch sighed as if it were to bring about the millennium,
and which was not accomplished by another Pope without embroiling him
with his Cardinals, was nevertheless more practicable than capturing
Jerusalem. We are told by several Italian writers that the aged Pontiff,
moved by repeated entreaties from the Romans, as well as by the remorse
of his conscience, thought seriously of effecting this restoration; but
the sincerity of his intentions is made questionable by the fact that he
never fixed himself at Rome. He wrote, it is true, to Rome in 1333,
ordering his palaces and gardens to be repaired; but the troubles which
continued to agitate the city were alleged by him as too alarming for
his safety there, and he repaired to Bologna to wait for quieter times.</p>

<p>On both of the above subjects, namely, the insane crusades and the more
feasible restoration of the papal court to Rome, Petrarch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> wrote with
devoted zeal; they are both alluded to in his twenty-second sonnet.</p>

<p>The death of John XXII. left the Cardinals divided into two great
factions. The first was that of the French, at the head of which stood
Cardinal Taillerand, son of the beautiful Brunissende de Foix, whose
charms were supposed to have detained Pope Clement V. in France. The
Italian Cardinals, who formed the opposite faction, had for their chief
the Cardinal Colonna. The French party, being the more numerous, were,
in some sort, masters of the election; they offered the tiara to
Cardinal de Commenges, on condition that he would promise not to
transfer the papal court to Rome. That prelate showed himself worthy of
the dignity, by refusing to accept it on such terms.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the world, the choice of the conclave fell at last on
James Founder, said to be the son of a baker at Savordun, who had been
bred as a monk of Citeaux, and always wore the dress of the order. Hence
he was called the White Cardinal. He was wholly unlike his portly
predecessor John in figure and address, being small in stature, pale in
complexion, and weak in voice. He expressed his own astonishment at the
honour conferred on him, saying that they had elected an ass. If we may
believe Petrarch, he did himself no injustice in likening himself to
that quadruped; but our poet was somewhat harsh in his judgment of this
Pontiff. He took the name of Benedict XII.</p>

<p>Shortly after his exaltation, Benedict received ambassadors from Rome,
earnestly imploring him to bring back the sacred seat to their city; and
Petrarch thought he could not serve the embassy better than by
publishing a poem in Latin verse, exhibiting Rome in the character of a
desolate matron imploring her husband to return to her. Benedict
applauded the author of the epistle, but declined complying with its
prayer. Instead of revisiting Italy, his Holiness ordered a magnificent
and costly palace to be constructed for him at Avignon. Hitherto, it
would seem that the Popes had lived in hired houses. In imitation of
their Pontiff, the Cardinals set about building superb mansions, to the
unbounded indignation of Petrarch, who saw in these new habitations not
only a graceless and unchristian spirit of luxury, but a sure indication
that their owners had no thoughts of removing to Rome.</p>

<p>In the January of the following year, Pope Benedict presented our poet
with the canonicate of Lombes, with the expectancy of the first prebend
which should become vacant. This preferment Petrarch is supposed to have
owed to the influence of Cardinal Colonna.</p>

<p>The troubles which at this time agitated Italy drew to Avignon, in the
year 1335, a personage who holds a pre-eminent interest in the life of
Petrarch, namely, Azzo da Correggio, who was sent thither by the
Scaligeri of Parma. The State of Parma had be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>longed originally to the
popes; but two powerful families, the Rossis and the Correggios, had
profited by the quarrels between the church and the empire to usurp the
government, and during five-and-twenty years, Gilberto Correggio and
Rolando Rossi alternately lost and won the sovereignty, till, at last,
the confederate princes took the city, and conferred the government of
it on Guido Correggio, the greatest enemy of the Rossis.</p>

<p>Gilbert Correggio left at his death a widow, the sister of Cane de la
Scala, and four sons, Guido, Simone, Azzo, and Giovanni. It is only with
Azzo that we are particularly concerned in the history of Petrarch.</p>

<p>Azzo was born in the year 1303, being thus a year older than our poet.
Originally intended for the church, he preferred the sword to the
crozier, and became a distinguished soldier. He married the daughter of
Luigi Gonzagua, lord of Mantua. He was a man of bold original spirit,
and so indefatigable that he acquired the name of Iron-foot. Nor was his
energy merely physical; he read much, and forgot nothing&mdash;his memory was
a library. Azzo's character, to be sure, even with allowance for
turbulent times, is not invulnerable at all points to a rigid scrutiny;
and, notwithstanding all the praises of Petrarch, who dedicated to him
his Treatise on a Solitary Life in 1366, his political career contained
some acts of perfidy. But we must inure ourselves, in the biography of
Petrarch, to his over-estimation of favourites in the article of morals.</p>

<p>It was not long ere Petrarch was called upon to give a substantial proof
of his regard for Azzo. After the seizure of Parma by the confederate
princes, Marsilio di Rossi, brother of Rolando, went to Paris to demand
assistance from the French king. The King of Bohemia had given over the
government of Parma to him and his brothers, and the Rossi now saw it
with grief assigned to his enemies, the Correggios. Marsilio could
obtain no succour from the French, who were now busy in preparing for
war with the English; so he carried to the Pope at Avignon his
complaints against the alleged injustice of the lords of Verona and the
Correggios in breaking an express treaty which they had made with the
house of Rossi.</p>

<p>Azzo had the threefold task of defending, before the Pope's tribunal,
the lords of Verona, whose envoy he was; the rights of his family, which
were attacked; and his own personal character, which was charged with
some grave objections. Revering the eloquence and influence of Petrarch,
he importuned him to be his public defender. Our poet, as we have seen,
had studied the law, but had never followed the profession. "It is not
my vocation," he says, in his preface to his Familiar Epistles, "to
undertake the defence of others. I detest the bar; I love retirement; I
despise money; and, if I tried to let out my tongue for hire, my nature
would revolt at the attempt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>But what Petrarch would not undertake either from taste or motives of
interest, he undertook at the call of friendship. He pleaded the cause
of Azzo before the Pope and Cardinals; it was a finely-interesting
cause, that afforded a vast field for his eloquence. He brought off his
client triumphantly; and the Rossis were defeated in their demand.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is a proud trait in Petrarch's character that he
showed himself on this occasion not only an orator and a lawyer, but a
perfect gentleman. In the midst of all his zealous pleading, he stooped
neither to satire nor personality against the opposing party. He could
say, with all the boldness of truth, in a letter to Ugolino di Rossi,
the Bishop of Parma, "I pleaded against your house for Azzo Correggio,
but you were present at the pleading; do me justice, and confess that I
carefully avoided not only attacks on your family and reputation, but
even those railleries in which advocates so much delight."</p>

<p>On this occasion, Azzo had brought to Avignon, as his colleague in the
lawsuit, Guglielmo da Pastrengo, who exercised the office of judge and
notary at Verona. He was a man of deep knowledge in the law; versed,
besides, in every branch of elegant learning, he was a poet into the
bargain. In Petrarch's many books of epistles, there are few letters
addressed by him to this personage; but it is certain that they
contracted a friendship at this period which endured for life.</p>

<p>All this time the Bishop of Lombes still continued at Rome; and, from
time to time, solicited his friend Petrarch to join him. "Petrarch would
have gladly joined him," says De Sade; "but he was detained at Avignon
by his attachment to John Colonna and his love of Laura:" a whimsical
junction of detaining causes, in which the fascination of the Cardinal
may easily be supposed to have been weaker than that of Laura. In
writing to our poet, at Avignon, the Bishop rallied Petrarch on the
imaginary existence of the object of his passion. Some stupid readers of
the Bishop's letter, in subsequent times, took it into their heads that
there was a literal proof in the prelate's jesting epistle of our poet's
passion for Laura being a phantom and a fiction. But, possible as it may
be, that the Bishop in reality suspected him to exaggerate the flame of
his devotion for the two great objects of his idolatry, Laura and St.
Augustine, he writes in a vein of pleasantry that need not be taken for
grave accusation. "You are befooling us all, my dear Petrarch," says the
prelate; "and it is wonderful that at so tender an age (Petrarch's
tender age was at this time thirty-one) you can deceive the world with
so much art and success. And, not content with deceiving the world, you
would fain deceive Heaven itself. You make a semblance of loving St.
Augustine and his works; but, in your heart, you love the poets and the
philosophers. Your Laura is a phantom created by your imagination for
the exercise of your poetry. Your verse, your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> love, your sighs, are all
a fiction; or, if there is anything real in your passion, it is not for
the lady Laura, but for the laurel&mdash;<i>that is</i>, the crown of poets. I
have been your dupe for some time, and, whilst you showed a strong
desire to visit Rome, I hoped to welcome you there. But my eyes are now
opened to all your rogueries, which nevertheless, will not prevent me
from loving you."</p>

<p>Petrarch, in his answer to the Bishop,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> says, "My father, if I love
the poets, I only follow, in this respect, the example of St. Augustine.
I take the sainted father himself to witness the sincerity of my
attachment to him. He is now in a place where he can neither deceive nor
be deceived. I flatter myself that he pities my errors, especially when
he recalls his own." St. Augustine had been somewhat profligate in his
younger days.</p>

<p>"As to Laura," continues the poet, "would to Heaven that she were only
an imaginary personage, and my passion for her only a pastime! Alas! it
is a madness which it would be difficult and painful to feign for any
length of time; and what an extravagance it would be to affect such a
passion! One may counterfeit illness by action, by voice, and by manner,
but no one in health can give himself the true air and complexion of
disease. How often have you yourself been witness of my paleness and my
sufferings! I know very well that you speak only in irony: it is your
favourite figure of speech, but I hope that time will cicatrize these
wounds of my spirit, and that Augustine, whom I pretend to love, will
furnish me with a defence against a Laura who does not exist."</p>

<p>Years had now elapsed since Petrarch had conceived his passion for
Laura; and it was obviously doomed to be a source of hopeless torment to
him as long as he should continue near her; for she could breathe no
more encouragement on his love than what was barely sufficient to keep
it alive; and, if she had bestowed more favour on him, the consequences
might have been ultimately most tragic to both of them. His own
reflections, and the advice of his friends, suggested that absence and
change of objects were the only means likely to lessen his misery; he
determined, therefore, to travel once more, and set out for Rome in
1335.</p>

<p>The wish to assuage his passion, by means of absence, was his principal
motive for going again upon his travels; but, before he could wind up
his resolution to depart, the state of his mind bordered on distraction.
One day he observed a country girl washing the veil of Laura; a sudden
trembling seized him&mdash;and, though the heat of the weather was intense,
he grew cold and shivered. For some time he was incapable of applying to
study or business. His soul, he said, was like a field of battle, where
his passion and reason held continual conflict. In his calmer moments,
many agreeable motives for travelling suggested them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>selves to his mind.
He had a strong desire to visit Rome, where he was sure of finding the
kindest welcome from the Bishop of Lombes. He was to pass through Paris
also; and there he had left some valued friends, to whom he had promised
that he would return. At the head of those friends were Dionisio dal
Borgo San Sepolcro and Roberto Bardi, a Florentine, whom the Pope had
lately made chancellor of the Church of Paris, and given him the
canonship of N&ocirc;tre Dame. Dionisio dal Borgo was a native of Tuscany, and
one of the Roberti family. His name in literature was so considerable
that Filippo Villani thought it worth while to write his life. Petrarch
wrote his funeral eulogy, and alludes to Dionisio's power of reading
futurity by the stars. But Petrarch had not a grain of faith in
astrology; on the contrary, he has himself recorded that he derided it.
After having obtained, with some difficulty, the permission of Cardinal
Colonna, he took leave of his friends at Avignon, and set out for
Marseilles. Embarking there in a ship that was setting sail for Civita
Vecchia, he concealed his name, and gave himself out for a pilgrim going
to worship at Rome. Great was his joy when, from the deck, he could
discover the coast of his beloved Italy. It was a joy, nevertheless,
chastened by one indomitable recollection&mdash;that of the idol he had left
behind. On his landing he perceived a laurel tree; its name seemed to
typify her who dwelt for ever in his heart: he flew to embrace it; but
in his transports overlooked a brook that was between them, into which
he fell&mdash;and the accident caused him to swoon. Always occupied with
Laura, he says, "On those shores washed by the Tyrrhene sea, I beheld
that stately laurel which always warms my imagination, and, through my
impatience, fell breathless into the intervening stream. I was alone,
and in the woods, yet I blushed at my own heedlessness; for, to the
reflecting mind, no witness is necessary to excite the emotion of
shame."</p>

<p>It was not easy for Petrarch to pass from the coast of Tuscany to Rome;
for war between the Ursini and Colonna houses had been renewed with more
fury than ever, and filled all the surrounding country with armed men.
As he had no escort, he took refuge in the castle of Capranica, where he
was hospitably received by Orso, Count of Anguillara, who had married
Agnes Colonna, sister of the Cardinal and the Bishop. In his letter to
the latter, Petrarch luxuriates in describing the romantic and rich
landscape of Capranica, a country believed by the ancients to have been
the first that was cultivated under the reign of Saturn. He draws,
however, a frightful contrast to its rural picture in the horrors of war
which here prevailed. "Peace," he says, "is the only charm which I could
not find in this beautiful region. The shepherd, instead of guarding
against wolves, goes armed into the woods to defend himself against men.
The labourer, in a coat of mail, uses a lance instead of a goad, to
drive his cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> The fowler covers himself with a shield as he draws
his nets; the fisherman carries a sword whilst he hooks his fish; and
the native draws water from the well in an old rusty casque, instead of
a pail. In a word, arms are used here as tools and implements for all
the labours of the field, and all the wants of men. In the night are
heard dreadful howlings round the walls of towns, and and in the day
terrible voices crying incessantly to arms. What music is this compared
with those soft and harmonious sounds which. I drew from my lute at
Avignon!"</p>

<p>On his arrival at Capranica, Petrarch despatched a courier to the Bishop
of Lombes, informing him where he was, and of his inability to get to
Rome, all roads to it being beset by the enemy. The Bishop expressed
great joy at his friend's arrival in Italy, and went to meet him at
Capranica, with Stefano Colonna, his brother, senator of Rome. They had
with them only a troop of one hundred horsemen; and, considering that
the enemy kept possession of the country with five hundred men, it is
wonderful that they met with no difficulties on their route; but the
reputation of the Colonnas had struck terror into the hostile camp. They
entered Rome without having had a single skirmish with the enemy.
Stefano Colonna, in his quality of senator, occupied the Capitol, where
he assigned apartments to Petrarch; and the poet was lodged on that
famous hill which Scipio, Metellus, and Pompey, had ascended in triumph.
Petrarch was received and treated by the Colonnas Like a child of their
family. The venerable old Stefano, who had known him at Avignon, loaded
our poet with kindness. But, of all the family, it would seem that
Petrarch delighted most in the conversation of Giovanni da S. Vito, a
younger brother of the aged Stefano, and uncle of the Cardinal and
Bishop. Their tastes were congenial. Giovanni had made a particular
study of the antiquities of Rome; he was, therefore, a most welcome
cicerone to our poet, being, perhaps, the only Roman then alive, who
understood the subject deeply, if we except Cola di Rienzo, of whom we
shall soon have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>In company with Giovanni, Petrarch inspected the relics of the "eternal
city:" the former was more versed than his companion in ancient history,
but the other surpassed him in acquaintance with modern times, as well
as with the objects of antiquity that stood immediately before them.</p>

<p>What an interesting object is Petrarch contemplating the ruins of Rome!
He wrote to the Cardinal Colonna as follows:&mdash;"I gave you so long an
account of Capranica that you may naturally expect a still longer
description of Rome. My materials for this subject are, indeed,
inexhaustible; but they will serve for some future opportunity. At
present, I am so wonder-struck by so many great objects that I know not
where to begin. One circumstance, however, I cannot omit, which has
turned out contrary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> your surmises. You represented to me that Rome
was a city in ruins, and that it would not come up to the imagination I
had formed of it; but this has not happened&mdash;on the contrary, my most
sanguine expectations have been surpassed. Rome is greater, and her
remains are more awful, than my imagination had conceived. It is not
matter of wonder that she acquired universal dominion. I am only
surprised that it was so late before she came to it."</p>

<p>In the midst of his meditations among the relics of Rome, Petrarch was
struck by the ignorance about their forefathers, with which the natives
looked on those monuments. The veneration which they had for them was
vague and uninformed. "It is lamentable," he says, "that nowhere in the
world is Rome less known than at Rome."</p>

<p>It is not exactly known in what month Petrarch left the Roman capital;
but, between his departure from that city, and his return to the banks
of the Rhone, he took an extensive tour over Europe. He made a voyage
along its southern coasts, passed the straits of Gibraltar, and sailed
as far northward as the British shores. During his wanderings, he wrote
a letter to Tommaso da Messina, containing a long geographical
dissertation on the island of Thule.</p>

<p>Petrarch approached the British shores; why were they not fated to have
the honour of receiving him? Ah! but who was there, then, in England
that was capable of receiving him? Chaucer was but a child. We had the
names of some learned men, but our language had no literature. Time
works wonders in a few centuries; and England, <i>now</i> proud of her
Shakespeare and her Verulam, looks not with envy on the glory of any
earthly nation. During his excitement by these travels, a singular
change took place in our poet's habitual feelings. He recovered his
health and spirits; he could bear to think of Laura with equanimity, and
his countenance resumed the cheerfulness that was natural to a man in
the strength of his age. Nay, he became so sanguine in his belief that
he had overcome his passion as to jest at his past sufferings; and, in
this gay state of mind, he came back to Avignon. This was the crowning
misfortune of his life. He saw Laura once more; he was enthralled anew;
and he might now laugh in agony at his late self-congratulations on his
delivery from her enchantment. With all the pity that we bestow on
unfortunate love, and with all the respect that we owe to its constancy,
still we cannot look but with a regret amounting to impatience on a man
returning to the spot that was to rekindle his passion as recklessly as
a moth to the candle, and binding himself over for life to an affection
that was worse than hopeless, inasmuch as its success would bring more
misery than its failure. It is said that Petrarch, if it had not been
for this passion, would not have been the poet that he was. Not,
perhaps, so good an amatory poet; but I firmly believe that he would
have been a more various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> and masculine, and, upon the whole, <i>a greater
poet</i>, if he had never been bewitched by Laura. However, <i>he did</i> return
to take possession of his canonicate at Lombes, and to lose possession
of his peace of mind.</p>

<p>In the April of the following year, 1336, he made an excursion, in
company with his brother Gherardo, to the top of Mount Ventoux, in the
neighbourhood of Avignon; a full description of which he sent in a
letter to Dionisio dal Borgo a San Sepolcro; but there is nothing
peculiarly interesting in this occurrence.</p>

<p>A more important event in his life took place during the following year,
1337&mdash;namely, that he had a son born to him, whom he christened by the
name of John, and to whom he acknowledged his relationship of paternity.
With all his philosophy and platonic raptures about Laura, Petrarch was
still subject to the passions of ordinary men, and had a mistress at
Avignon who was kinder to him than Laura. Her name and history have been
consigned to inscrutable obscurity: the same woman afterwards bore him a
daughter, whose name was Francesca, and who proved a great solace to him
in his old age. His biographers extol the magnanimity of Laura for
displaying no anger at our poet for what they choose to call this
discovery of his infidelity to her; but, as we have no reason to suppose
that Laura ever bestowed one favour on Petrarch beyond a pleasant look,
it is difficult to perceive her right to command his unspotted faith. At
all events, she would have done no good to her own reputation if she had
stormed at the lapse of her lover's virtue.</p>

<p>In a small city like Avignon, the scandal of his intrigue would
naturally be a matter of regret to his friends and of triumph to his
enemies. Petrarch felt his situation, and, unable to calm his mind
either by the advice of his friend Dionisio dal Borgo, or by the perusal
of his favourite author, St. Augustine, he resolved to seek a rural
retreat, where he might at least hide his tears and his mortification.
Unhappily he chose a spot not far enough from Laura&mdash;namely, Vaucluse,
which is fifteen Italian, or about fourteen English, miles from Avignon.</p>

<p>Vaucluse, or Vallis Clausa, the shut-up valley, is a most beautiful
spot, watered by the windings of the Sorgue. Along the river there are
on one side most verdant plains and meadows, here and there shadowed by
trees. On the other side are hills covered with corn and vineyards.
Where the Sorgue rises, the view terminates in the cloud-capt ridges of
the mountains Luberoux and Ventoux. This was the place which Petrarch
had visited with such delight when he was a schoolboy, and at the sight
of which he exclaimed "that he would prefer it as a residence to the
most splendid city."</p>

<p>It is, indeed, one of the loveliest seclusions in the world. It
terminates in a semicircle of rocks of stupendous height, that seem to
have been hewn down perpendicularly. At the head and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span> centre of the vast
amphitheatre, and at the foot of one of its enormous rocks, there is a
cavern of proportional size, hollowed out by the hand of nature. Its
opening is an arch sixty feet high; but it is a double cavern, there
being an interior one with an entrance thirty feet high. In the midst of
these there is an oval basin, having eighteen fathoms for its longest
diameter, and from this basin rises the copious stream which forms the
Sorgue. The surface of the fountain is black, an appearance produced by
its depth, from the darkness of the rocks, and the obscurity of the
cavern; for, on being brought to light, nothing can be clearer than its
water. Though beautiful to the eye, it is harsh to the taste, but is
excellent for tanning and dyeing; and it is said to promote the growth
of a plant which fattens oxen and is good for hens during incubation.
Strabo and Pliny the naturalist both speak of its possessing this
property.</p>

<p>The river Sorgue, which issues from this cavern, divides in its progress
into various branches; it waters many parts of Provence, receives
several tributary streams, and, after reuniting its branches, falls into
the Rhone near Avignon.</p>

<p>Resolving to fix his residence here, Petrarch bought a little cottage
and an adjoining field, and repaired to Vaucluse with no other
companions than his books. To this day the ruins of a small house are
shown at Vaucluse, which tradition says was his habitation.</p>

<p>If his object was to forget Laura, the composition of sonnets upon her
in this hermitage was unlikely to be an antidote to his recollections.
It would seem as if he meant to cherish rather than to get rid of his
love. But, if he nursed his passion, it was a dry-nursing; for he led a
lonely, ascetic, and, if it were not for his studies, we might say a
savage life. In one of his letters, written not long after his settling
at Vaucluse, he says, "Here I make war upon my senses, and treat them as
my enemies. My eyes, which have drawn me into a thousand difficulties,
see no longer either gold, or precious stones, or ivory, or purple; they
behold nothing save the water, the firmament, and the rocks. The only
female who comes within their sight is a swarthy old woman, dry and
parched as the Lybian deserts. My ears are no longer courted by those
harmonious instruments and voices which have so often transported my
soul: they hear nothing but the lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep,
the warbling of birds, and the murmurs of the river.</p>

<p>"I keep silence from noon till night. There is no one to converse with;
for the good people, employed in spreading their nets, or tending their
vines and orchards, are no great adepts at conversation. I often content
myself with the brown bread of the fisherman, and even eat it with
pleasure. Nay, I almost prefer it to white bread. This old fisherman,
who is as hard as iron, earnestly remonstrates against my manner of
life; and assures me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> that I cannot long hold out. I am, on the
contrary, convinced that it is easier to accustom one's self to a plain
diet than to the luxuries of a feast. But still I have my
luxuries&mdash;figs, raisins, nuts and almonds. I am fond of the fish with
which this stream abounds, and I sometimes amuse myself with spreading
the nets. As to my dress, there is an entire change; you would take me
for a labourer or a shepherd.</p>

<p>"My mansion resembles that of Cato or Fabricius. My whole
house-establishment consists of myself, my old fisherman and his wife,
and a dog. My fisherman's cottage is contiguous to mine; when I want him
I call; when I no longer need him, he returns to his cottage.</p>

<p>"I have made two gardens that please me wonderfully. I do not think they
are to be equalled in all the world. And I must confess to you a more
than female weakness with which I am haunted. I am positively angry that
there is anything so beautiful out of Italy.</p>

<p>"One of these gardens is shady, formed for contemplation, and sacred to
Apollo. It overhangs the source of the river, and is terminated by
rocks, and by places accessible only to birds. The other is nearer my
cottage, of an aspect less severe, and devoted to Bacchus; and what is
extremely singular, it is in the midst of a rapid river. The approach to
it is over a bridge of rocks; and there is a natural grotto under the
rocks, which gives them the appearance of a rustic bridge. Into this
grotto the rays of the sun never penetrate. I am confident that it much
resembles the place where Cicero went to declaim. It invites to study.
Hither I retreat during the noontide hours; my mornings are engaged upon
the hills, or in the garden sacred to Apollo. Here I would most
willingly pass my days, were I not too near Avignon, and too far from
Italy. For why should I conceal this weakness of my soul? I love Italy,
and I hate Avignon. The pestilential influence of this horrid place
empoisons the pure air of Vaucluse, and will compel me to quit my
retirement."</p>

<p>It is clear that he was not supremely contented in his solitude with his
self-drawn mental resources. His friends at Avignon came seldom to see
him. Travelling even short distances was difficult in those days. Even
we, in the present day, can remember when the distance of fourteen miles
presented a troublesome journey. The few guests who came, to him could
not expect very exquisite dinners, cooked by the brown old woman and her
husband the fisherman; and, though our poet had a garden consecrated to
Bacchus, he had no cellar devoted to the same deity. His few friends,
therefore, who visited him, thought their angel visits acts of charity.
If he saw his friends seldom, however, he had frequent visitants in
strangers who came to Vaucluse, as a place long celebrated for its
natural beauties, and now made illustrious by the character and
compositions of our poet. Among these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> there were persons distinguished
for their rank or learning, who came from the farthest parts of France
and from Italy, to see and converse with Petrarch. Some of them even
sent before them considerable presents, which, though kindly meant, were
not acceptable.</p>

<p>Vaucluse is in the diocese of Cavaillon, a small city about two miles
distant from our poet's retreat. Philip de Cabassoles was the bishop, a
man of high rank and noble family. His disposition, according to
Petrarch's usual praise of his friends, was highly benevolent and
humane; he was well versed in literature, and had distinguished
abilities. No sooner was the poet settled in his retirement, than he
visited the Bishop at his palace near Vaucluse. The latter gave him a
friendly reception, and returned his visits frequently. Another much
estimated, his friend since their childhood, Guido Sette, also repaired
at times to his humble mansion, and relieved his solitude in the shut-up
valley.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Without some daily and constant occupation even the bright mind of
Petrarch would have rusted, like the finest steel when it is left
unscoured. But he continued his studies with an ardour that commands our
wonder and respect; and it was at Vaucluse that he either meditated or
wrote his most important compositions. Here he undertook a history of
Rome, from Romulus down to Titus Vespasian. This Herculean task he never
finished; but there remain two fragments of it, namely, four books, De
Rebus Memorandis, and another tract entitled Vitarum Virorum Illustrium
Epitome, being sketches of illustrious men from the founder of Rome down
to Fabricius.</p>

<p>About his poem, Africa, I shall only say for the present that he began
this Latin epic at Vaucluse, that its hero is his idolized Roman, Scipio
Africanus, that it gained him a reputation over Europe, and that he was
much pleased with it himself, but that his admiration of it in time
cooled down so much, that at last he was annoyed when it was mentioned
to him, and turned the conversation, if he could, to a different
subject. Nay, it is probable, that if it had not been for Boccaccio and
Coluccio Salutati, who, long after he had left Vaucluse, importuned him
to finish and publish it, his Africa would not have come down to
posterity.</p>

<p>Petrarch alludes in one of his letters to an excursion which he made in
1338, in company with a man whose rank was above his wisdom. He does not
name him, but it seems clearly to have been Humbert II., Dauphin of the
Viennois. The Cardinal Colonna forced our poet into this pilgrimage to
Baume, famous for its adjacent cavern, where, according to the tradition
of the country, Mary Magdalen passed thirty years of repentance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> In
that holy but horrible cavern, as Petrarch calls it, they remained three
days and three nights, though Petrarch sometimes gave his comrades the
slip, and indulged in rambles among the hills and forests; he composed a
short poem, however, on St. Mary Magdalen, which is as dull as the cave
itself. The Dauphin Humbert was not a bright man; but he seems to have
contracted a friendly familiarity with our poet, if we may judge by a
letter which Petrarch indited to him about this time, frankly
reproaching him with his political neutrality in the affairs of Europe.
It was supposed that the Cardinal Colonna incited him to write it. A
struggle that was now impending between France and England engaged all
Europe on one side or other. The Emperor Lewis had intimated to Humbert
that he must follow him in this war, he, the Dauphin, being
arch-seneschal of Arles and Vienne. Next year, the arch-seneschal
received an invitation from Philip of Valois to join him with his troops
at Amiens as vassal of France. The Dauphin tried to back out of the
dilemma between his two suitors by frivolous excuses to both, all the
time determining to assist neither. In 1338 he came to Avignon, and the
Pope gave him his palace at the bridge of the Sorgue for his habitation.
Here the poor craven, beset on one side by threatening letters from
Philip of Valois, and on the other by importunities from the French
party at the papal court, remained in Avignon till July, 1339, after
Petrarch had let loose upon him his epistolary eloquence.</p>

<p>This letter, dated April, 1339, is, according to De Sade's opinion, full
of powerful persuasion. I cannot say that it strikes me as such. After
calling Christ to witness that he writes to the Dauphin in the spirit of
friendship, he reminds him that Europe had never exhibited so mighty and
interesting a war as that which had now sprung up between the kings of
France and England, nor one that opened so vast a field of glory for the
brave. "All the princes and their people," he says, "are anxious about
its issue, especially those between the Alps and the ocean, who take
arms at the crash of the neighbouring tumult; whilst you alone go to
sleep amidst the clouds of the coming storm. To say the truth, if there
was nothing more than shame to awaken you, it ought to rouse you from
this lethargy. I had thought you," he continues, "a man desirous of
glory. You are young and in the strength of life. What, then, in the
name of God, keeps you inactive? Do you fear fatigue? Remember what
Sallust says&mdash;'Idle enjoyments were made for women, fatigue was made for
men.' Do you fear death? Death is the last debt we owe to nature, and
man ought not to fear it; certainly he ought not to fear it more than
sleep and sluggishness. Aristotle, it is true, calls death the last of
horrible things; but, mind, he does not call it the most horrible of
things." In this manner, our poet goes on moralizing on the blessings of
an early death, and the great advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>tage that it would have afforded to
some excellent Roman heroes if they had met with it sooner. The only
thing like a sensible argument that he urges is, that Humbert could not
expect to save himself even by neutrality, but must ultimately become
the prey of the victor, and be punished like the Alban Metius, whom
Tullus Hostilius caused to be torn asunder by horses that pulled his
limbs in different directions. The pedantic epistle had no effect on
Humbert.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Italy had no repose more than the rest of Europe, but its
troubles gave a happy occasion to Petrarch to see once more his friend,
Guglielmo Pastrengo, who, in 1338, came to Avignon, from Mastino della
Scala, lord of Verona.</p>

<p>The moment Petrarch heard of his friend's arrival he left his hermitage
to welcome him; but scarcely had he reached the fatal city when he saw
the danger of so near an approach to the woman he so madly loved, and
was aware that he had no escape from the eyes of Laura but by flight. He
returned, therefore, all of a sudden to Vaucluse, without waiting for a
sight of Pastrengo. Shortly after he had quitted the house of L&aelig;lius,
where he usually lodged when he went to Avignon, Guglielmo, expecting to
find him there, knocked at the door, but no one opened it&mdash;called out,
but no one answered him. He therefore wrote him a little billet, saying,
"My dear Petrarch, where have you hid yourself, and whither have you
vanished? What is the meaning of all this?" The poet received this note
at Vaucluse, and sent an explanation of his flight, sincere indeed as to
good feelings, but prolix as usual in the expression of them. Pastrengo
sent him a kind reply, and soon afterwards did him the still greater
favour of visiting him at Vaucluse, and helping him to cultivate his
garden.</p>

<p>Petrarch's flame for Laura was in reality unabated. One day he met her
in the streets of Avignon; for he had not always resolution enough to
keep out of the western Babylon. Laura cast a kind look upon him, and
said, "Petrarch, you are tired of loving me." This incident produced one
of the finest sonnets, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6"><i>Io non fut d' amar voi lassato unquanco.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tired, did you say, of loving you? Oh, no!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ne'er shall tire of the unwearying flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am weary, kind and cruel dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears that uselessly and ceaseless flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning myself, and scorn'd by you. I long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death: but let no gravestone hold in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our names conjoin'd: nor tell my passion strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dust that glow'd through life for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet this heart of amorous faith demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves, a better boon; but cruel, hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is my fortune, I will bless Love's bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, if you give me this reward.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1339, he composed among other sonnets, those three, the lxii.,
lxxiv., and lxxv., which are confessedly master-pieces of their kind, as
well as three canzoni to the eyes of Laura, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span> the Italians call the
three sister Graces, and worship as divine.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> The critic Tassoni
himself could not censure them, and called them the queens of song. At
this period, however seldom he may have visited Avignon, he evidently
sought rather to cherish than subdue his fatal attachment. A celebrated
painter, Simone Martini of Siena, came to Avignon. He was the pupil of
Giotto, not exquisite in drawing, but famous for taking spirited
likenesses.</p>

<p>Petrarch persuaded Simone to favour him with a miniature likeness of
Laura; and this treasure the poet for ever carried about with him. In
gratitude he addressed two sonnets to the artist, whose fame, great as
it was, was heightened by the poetical reward. Vasari tells us that
Simone also painted the pictures of both lovers in the chapel of St.
Maria Novella at Florence; that Simone was a sculptor as well as a
painter, and that he copied those pictures in marbles which, according
to Baldelli, are still extant in the house of the Signore Pruzzi.</p>

<p>An anecdote relating to this period of Petrarch's life is given by De
Sade, which, if accepted with entire credence, must inspire us with
astonishment at the poet's devotion to his literary pursuits. He had
now, in 1339, put the first hand to his epic poem, the Scipiade; and one
of his friends, De Sade believes that it was the Bishop of Lombes,
fearing lest he might injure his health by overzealous application, went
to ask him for the key of his library, which the poet gave up. The
Bishop then locked up his books and papers, and commanded him to abstain
from reading and writing for ten days. Petrarch obeyed; but on the first
day of this literary Ramazan, he was seized with ennui, on the second
with a severe headache, and on the third with symptoms of fever; the
Bishop relented, and permitted the student to return to his books and
papers.</p>

<p>Petrarch was at this time delighted, in his solitude of Vaucluse, to
hear of the arrival at Avignon of one of his dearest friends. This was
Dionisio dal Borgo a San Sepolcro, who, being now advanced in years, had
resigned his pulpit in the University of Paris, in order to return to
his native country, and came to Avignon with the intention of going by
sea to Florence. Petrarch pressed him strongly to visit him at Vaucluse,
interspersing his persuasion with many compliments to King Robert of
Naples, to whom he knew that Dionisio was much attached; nor was he
without hopes that his friend would speak favourably of him to his
Neapolitan Majesty. In a letter from Vaucluse he says:&mdash;"Can nothing
induce you to come to my solitude? Will not my ardent request, and the
pity you must have for my condition, bring you to pass some days with
your old disciple? If these motives are not sufficient, permit me to
suggest another inducement. There is in this place a poplar-tree of so
immense a size that it covers with its shade not only the river and its
banks, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span> also a considerable extent beyond them. They tell us that
King Robert of Naples, invited by the beauty of this spot, came hither
to unburthen his mind from the weight of public affairs, and to enjoy
himself in the shady retreat." The poet added many eulogies on his
Majesty of Naples, which, as he anticipated, reached the royal ear. It
seems not to be clear that Father Dionisio ever visited the poet at
Vaucluse; though they certainly had an interview at Avignon. To
Petrarch's misfortune, his friend's stay in that city was very short.
The monk proceeded to Florence, but he found there no shady retreat like
that of the poplar at Vaucluse. Florence was more than ever agitated by
internal commotions, and was this year afflicted by plague and famine.
This dismal state of the city determined Dionisio to accept an
invitation from King Robert to spend the remainder of his days at his
court.</p>

<p>This monarch had the happiness of giving additional publicity to
Petrarch's reputation. That the poet sought his patronage need not be
concealed; and if he used a little flattery in doing so, we must make
allowance for the adulatory instinct of the tuneful tribe. We cannot
live without bread upon bare reputation, or on the prospect of having
tombstones put over our bones, prematurely hurried to the grave by
hunger, when they shall be as insensible to praise as the stones
themselves. To speak seriously, I think that a poet sacrifices his
usefulness to himself and others, and an importance in society which may
be turned to public good, if he shuns the patronage that can be obtained
by unparasitical means.</p>

<p>Father Dionisio, upon his arrival at Naples, impressed the King with so
favourable an opinion of Petrarch that Robert wrote a letter to our
poet, enclosing an epitaph of his Majesty's own composition, on the
death of his niece Clementina. This letter is unhappily lost; but the
answer to it is preserved, in which Petrarch tells the monarch that his
epitaph rendered his niece an object rather of envy than of lamentation.
"O happy Clementina!" says the poet, "after passing through a transitory
life, you have attained a double immortality, one in heaven, and another
on earth." He then compares the posthumous good fortune of the princess
to that of Achilles, who had been immortalized by Homer. It is possible
that King Robert's letter to Petrarch was so laudatory as to require a
flattering answer. But this reverberated praise is rather overstrained.</p>

<p>Petrarch was now intent on obtaining the honour of Poet Laureate. His
wishes were at length gratified, and in a manner that made the offer
more flattering than the crown itself.</p>

<p>Whilst he still remained at Vaucluse, at nine o'clock in the morning of
the 1st of September, 1340, he received a letter from the Roman Senate,
pressingly inviting him to come and receive the crown of Poet Laureate
at Rome. He must have little notion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> of a poet's pride and vanity, who
cannot imagine the flushed countenance, the dilated eyes, and the
joyously-throbbing heart of Petrarch, whilst he read this letter. To be
invited by the Senate of Rome to such an honour might excuse him for
forgetting that Rome was not now what she had once been, and that the
substantial glory of his appointment was small in comparison with the
classic associations which formed its halo.</p>

<p>As if to keep up the fever of his joy, he received the same day, in the
afternoon, at four o'clock, another letter with the same offer, from
Roberto Bardi, Chancellor of the University of Paris, in which he
importuned him to be crowned as Poet Laureate at Paris. When we consider
the poet's veneration for Rome, we may easily anticipate that he would
give the preference to that city. That he might not, however, offend his
friend Roberto Bardi and the University of Paris, he despatched a
messenger to Cardinal Colonna, asking his advice upon the subject,
pretty well knowing that his patron's opinion would coincide with his
own wishes. The Colonna advised him to be crowned at Rome.</p>

<p>The custom of conferring this honour had, for a long time, been
obsolete. In the earliest classical ages, garlands were given as a
reward to valour and genius. Virgil exhibits his conquerors adorned with
them. The Romans adopted the custom from Greece, where leafy honours
were bestowed on victors at public games. This coronation of poets, it
is said, ceased under the reign of the Emperor Theodosius. After his
death, during the long subsequent barbarism of Europe, when literature
produced only rhyming monks, and when there were no more poets to crown,
the discontinuance of the practice was a natural consequence.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the thirteenth century, according to the Abb&eacute;
Resnel, the universities of Europe began to dispense laurels, not to
poets, but to students distinguished by their learning. The doctors in
medicine, at the famous university of Salerno, established by the
Emperor Frederic II., had crowns of laurel put upon their heads. The
bachelors also had their laurels, and derived their name from a baculus,
or stick, which they carried.</p>

<p>Cardinal Colonna, as we have said, advised him, "<i>nothing loth</i>," to
enjoy his coronation at Rome. Thither accordingly he repaired early in
the year 1341. He embarked at Marseilles for Naples, wishing previously
to his coronation to visit King Robert, by whom he was received with all
possible hospitality and distinction.</p>

<p>Though he had accepted the laurel amidst the general applause of his
contemporaries, Petrarch was not satisfied that he should enjoy this
honour without passing through an ordeal as to his learning, for laurels
and learning had been for one hundred years habitually associated in
men's minds. The person whom Petrarch selected for his examiner in
erudition was the King of Naples. Robert <i>the Good</i>, as he was in some
respects deservedly called, was, for his age, a well-instructed man,
and, for a king, a prodigy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span> He had also some common sense, but in
classical knowledge he was more fit to be the scholar of Petrarch than
his examiner. If Petrarch, however, learned nothing from the King, the
King learned something from Petrarch. Among the other requisites for
examining a Poet Laureate which Robert possessed, was <i>an utter
ignorance of poetry</i>. But Petrarch couched his blindness on the subject,
so that Robert saw, or believed he saw, something useful in the divine
art. He had heard of the epic poem, Africa, and requested its author to
recite to him some part of it. The King was charmed with the recitation,
and requested that the work might be dedicated to him. Petrarch
assented, but the poem was not finished or published till after King
Robert's death.</p>

<p>His Neapolitan Majesty, after pronouncing a warm eulogy on our poet,
declared that he merited the laurel, and had letters patent drawn up, by
which he certified that, after a <i>severe</i> examination (it lasted three
days), Petrarch was judged worthy to receive that honour in the Capitol.
Robert wished him to be crowned at Naples; but our poet represented that
he was desirous of being distinguished on the same theatre where Virgil
and Horace had shone. The King accorded with his wishes; and, to
complete his kindness, regretted that his advanced age would not permit
him to go to Rome, and crown Petrarch himself. He named, however, one of
his most eminent courtiers, Barrilli, to be his proxy. Boccaccio speaks
of Barrilli as a good poet; and Petrarch, with exaggerated politeness,
compares him to Ovid.</p>

<p>When Petrarch went to take leave of King Robert, the sovereign, after
engaging his promise that he would visit him again very soon, took off
the robe which he wore that day, and, begging Petrarch's acceptance of
it, desired that he might wear it on the day of his coronation. He also
bestowed on him the place of his almoner-general, an office for which
great interest was always made, on account of the privileges attached to
it, the principal of which were an exemption from paying the tithes of
benefices to the King, and a dispensation from residence.</p>

<p>Petrarch proceeded to Rome, where he arrived on the 6th of April, 1341,
accompanied by only one attendant from the court of Naples, for Barrilli
had taken another route, upon some important business, promising,
however, to be at Rome before the time appointed. But as he had not
arrived on the 7th, Petrarch despatched a messenger in search of him,
who returned without any information. The poet was desirous to wait for
his arrival; but Orso, Count of Anguillara, would not suffer the
ceremony to be deferred. Orso was joint senator of Rome with Giordano
degli Orsini; and, his office expiring on the 8th of April, he was
unwilling to resign to his successor the pleasure of crowning so great a
man.</p>

      alt="NAPLES."
      title="NAPLES." /></a><br />
   <span class="caption">NAPLES.</span>
</div>

<p>Petrarch was afterwards informed that Barrilli, hastening towards Rome,
had been beset near Anaguia by robbers, from whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span> he escaped with
difficulty, and that he was obliged for safety to return to Naples. In
leaving that city, Petrarch passed the tomb traditionally said to be
that of Virgil. His coronation took place without delay after his
arrival at Rome.</p>

<p>The morning of the 8th of April, 1341, was ushered in by the sound of
trumpets; and the people, ever fond of a show, came from all quarters to
see the ceremony. Twelve youths selected from the best families of Rome,
and clothed in scarlet, opened the procession, repeating as they went
some verses, composed by the poet, in honour of the Roman people. They
were followed by six citizens of Rome, clothed in green, and bearing
crowns wreathed with different flowers. Petrarch walked in the midst of
them; after him came the senator, accompanied by the first men of the
council. The streets were strewed with flowers, and the windows filled
with ladies, dressed in the most splendid manner, who showered perfumed
waters profusely on the poet<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>. He all the time wore the robe that had
been presented to him by the King of Naples. When they reached the
Capitol, the trumpets were silent, and Petrarch, having made a short
speech, in which he quoted a verse from Virgil, cried out three times,
"Long live the Roman people! long live the Senators! may God preserve
their liberty!" At the conclusion of these words, he knelt before the
senator Orso, who, taking a crown of laurel from his own head, placed it
on that of Petrarch, saying, "This crown is the reward of virtue." The
poet then repeated a sonnet in praise of the ancient Romans. The people
testified their approbation by shouts of applause, crying, "Long
flourish the Capitol and the poet!" The friends of Petrarch shed tears
of joy, and Stefano Colonna, his favourite hero, addressed the assembly
in his honour.</p>

<p>The ceremony having been finished at the Capitol, the procession, amidst
the sound of trumpets and the acclamations of the people, repaired
thence to the church of St. Peter, where Petrarch offered up his crown
of laurel before the altar. The same day the Count of Anguillara caused
letters patent to be delivered to Petrarch, in which the senators, after
a flattering preamble, declared that he had merited the title of a great
poet and historian; that, to mark his distinction, they had put upon his
head a laurel crown, not only by the authority of Kong Robert, but by
that of the Roman Senate and people; and that they gave him, at Rome and
elsewhere, the privilege to read, to dispute, to explain ancient books,
to make new ones, to compose poems, and to wear a crown according to his
choice, either of laurel, beech, or myrtle, as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> as the poetic
habit. At that time a particular dress was affected by the poets. Dante
was buried in this costume.</p>

<p>Petrarch continued only a few days at Rome after his coronation; but he
had scarcely departed when he found that there were banditti on the road
waiting for him, and anxious to relieve him of any superfluous wealth
which he might have about him. He was thus obliged to return to Rome
with all expedition; but he set out the following day, attended by a
guard of armed men, and arrived at Pisa on the 20th of April.</p>

<p>From Pisa he went to Parma, to see his friend Azzo Correggio, and soon
after his arrival he was witness to a revolution in that city of which
Azzo had the principal direction. The Scalas, who held the sovereignty
of Parma, had for some time oppressed the inhabitants with exorbitant
taxes, which excited murmurs and seditions. The Correggios, to whom the
city was entrusted in the absence of Mastino della Scala, profited by
the public discontent, hoisted the flag of liberty, and, on the 22nd of
May, 1341, drove out the garrison, and made themselves lords of the
commonwealth. On this occasion, Azzo has been accused of the worst
ingratitude to his nephews, Alberto and Mastino. But, if the people were
oppressed, he was surely justified in rescuing them from misgovernment.
To a great degree, also, the conduct of the Correggios sanctioned the
revolution. They introduced into Parma such a mild and equitable
administration as the city had never before experienced. Some
exceptionable acts they undoubtedly committed; and when Petrarch extols
Azzo as another Cato, it is to be hoped that he did so with some mental
reservation. Petrarch had proposed to cross the Alps immediately, and
proceed to Avignon; but he was prevailed upon by the solicitations of
Azzo to remain some time at Parma. He was consulted by the Correggios on
their most important affairs, and was admitted to their secret councils.
In the present instance, this confidence was peculiarly agreeable to
him; as the four brothers were, at that time, unanimous in their
opinions; and their designs were all calculated to promote the welfare
of their subjects.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival at Parma, he received one of those tokens, of his
popularity which are exceedingly expressive, though they come from a
humble admirer. A blind old man, who had been a grammar-school master at
Pontremoli, came to Parma, in order to pay his devotions to the
laureate. The poor man had already walked to Naples, guided in his
blindness by his only son, for the purpose of finding Petrarch. The poet
had left that city; but King Robert, pleased with his enthusiasm, made
him a present of some money. The aged pilgrim returned to Pontremoti,
where, being informed that Petrarch was at Parma, he crossed the
Apennines, in spite of the severity of the weather, and travelled
thither, having sent before him a tolerable copy of verses. He was
presented to Petrarch, whose hand he kissed with devotion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
exclamations of joy. One day, before many spectators, the blind man said
to Petrarch, "Sir, I have come far to see you." The bystanders laughed,
on which the old man replied, "I appeal to you, Petrarch, whether I do
not see you more clearly and distinctly than these men who have their
eyesight." Petrarch gave him a kind reception, and dismissed him with a
considerable present.</p>

<p>The pleasure which Petrarch had in retirement, reading, and reflection,
induced him to hire a house on the outskirts of the city of Parma, with
a garden, beautifully watered by a stream, a <i>rus in urbe</i>, as he calls
it; and he was so pleased with this locality, that he purchased and
embellished it.</p>

<p>His happiness, however, he tells us, was here embittered by the loss of
some friends who shared the first place in his affections. One of these
was Tommaso da Messina, with whom he had formed a friendship when they
were fellow-students at Bologna, and ever since kept up a familiar
correspondence. They were of the same age, addicted to the same
pursuits, and imbued with similar sentiments. Tommaso wrote a volume of
Latin poems, several of which were published after the invention of
printing. Petrarch, in his Triumphs of Love, reckons him an excellent
poet.</p>

<p>This loss was followed by another which affected Petrarch still more
strongly. Having received frequent invitations to Lombes from the
Bishop, who had resided some time in his diocese, Petrarch looked
forward with pleasure to the time when he should revisit him. But he
received accounts that the Bishop was taken dangerously ill. Whilst his
mind was agitated by this news, he had the following dream, which he has
himself related. "Methought I saw the Bishop crossing the rivulet of my
garden alone. I was astonished at this meeting, and asked him whence he
came, whither he was going in such haste, and why he was alone. He
smiled upon me with his usual complacency, and said, 'Remember that when
you were in Gascony the tempestuous climate was insupportable to you. I
also am tired of it. I have quitted Gascony, never to return, and I am
going to Rome.' At the conclusion of these words, he had reached the end
of the garden, and, as I endeavoured to accompany him, he in the kindest
and gentlest manner waved his hand; but, upon my persevering, he cried
out in a more peremptory manner, 'Stay! you must not at present attend
me.' Whilst he spoke these words, I fixed my eyes upon him, and saw the
paleness of death upon his countenance. Seized with horror, I uttered a
loud cry, which awoke me. I took notice of the time. I told the
circumstance to all my friends; and, at the expiration of
five-and-twenty days, I received accounts of his death, which happened
in the very same night in winch he had appeared to me."</p>

<p>On a little reflection, this incident will not appear to be
supernatural. That Petrarch, oppressed as he was with anxiety about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span> his
friend, should fall into fanciful reveries during his sleep, and imagine
that he saw him in the paleness of death, was nothing wonderful&mdash;nay,
that he should frame this allegory in his dream is equally conceivable.
The sleeper's imagination is often a great improvisatore. It forms
scenes and stories; it puts questions, and answers them itself, all the
time believing that the responses come from those whom it interrogates.</p>

<p>Petrarch, deeply attached to Azzo da Correggio, now began to consider
himself as settled at Parma, where he enjoyed literary retirement in the
bosom of his beloved Italy. But he had not resided there a year, when he
was summoned to Avignon by orders he considered that he could not
disobey. Tiraboschi, and after him Baldelli, ascribe his return to
Avignon to the commission which he received in 1342, to go as advocate
of the Roman people to the new Pope, Clement VI., who had succeeded to
the tiara on the death of Benedict XII., and Petrarch's own words
coincide with what they say. The feelings of joy with which Petrarch
revisited Avignon, though to appearance he had weaned himself from
Laura, may be imagined. He had friendship, however, if he had not love,
to welcome him. Here he met, with reciprocal gladness, his friends
Socrates and L&aelig;lius, who had established themselves at the court of the
Cardinal Colonna. "Socrates," says De Sade, "devoted himself entirely to
Petrarch, and even went with him to Vaucluse." It thus appears that
Petrarch had not given up his peculium on the Sorgue, nor had any one
rented the field and cottage in his absence.</p>

<p>Benedict's successor, Clement VI., was conversant with the world, and
accustomed to the splendour of courts. Quite a contrast to the plain
rigidity of Benedict, he was courteous and munificent, but withal a
voluptuary; and his luxury and profusion gave rise to extortions, to
rapine, and to boundless simony. His artful and arrogant mistress, the
Countess of Turenne, ruled him so absolutely, that all places in his
gift, which had escaped the grasp of his relations, were disposed of
through her interest; and she amassed great wealth by the sale of
benefices.</p>

<p>The Romans applied to Clement VI., as they had applied to Benedict XII.,
imploring him to bring back the sacred seat to their capital; and they
selected Petrarch to be among those who should present their
supplication. Our poet appealed to his Holiness on this subject, both in
prose and verse. The Pope received him with smiles, complimented him on
his eloquence, bestowed on him the priory of Migliorino, but, for the
present, consigned his remonstrance to oblivion.</p>

<p>In this mission to Clement at Avignon there was joined with Petrarch the
famous Nicola Gabrino, better known by the name Cola di Rienzo, who,
very soon afterwards, attached the history of Rome to his biography. He
was for the present comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span> little known; but Petrarch, thus
coming into connection with this extraordinary person, was captivated
with his eloquence, whilst Clement complimented Rienzo, admitted him
daily to his presence, and conversed with him on the wretched state of
Rome, the tyranny of the nobles, and the sufferings of the people.</p>

<p>Cola and Petrarch were the two chiefs of this Roman embassy to the Pope;
and it appears that the poet gave precedency to the future tribune on
this occasion. They both elaborately exposed the three demands of the
Roman people, namely, that the Pope, already the acknowledged patron of
Rome, should assume the title and functions of its senator, in order to
extinguish the civil wars kindled by the Roman barons; that he should
return to his pontifical chair on the banks of the Tiber; and that he
should grant permission for the jubilee, instituted by Boniface VIII.,
to be held every fifty years, and not at the end of a century, as its
extension to the latter period went far beyond the ordinary duration of
human life, and cut off the greater part of the faithful from enjoying
the institution.</p>

<p>Clement praised both orators, and conceded that the Romans should have a
jubilee every fifty years; but he excused himself from going to Rome,
alleging that he was prevented by the disputes between France and
England. "Holy Father," said Petrarch, "how much it were to be wished
that you had known Italy before you knew France." "I wish I had," said
the Pontiff, very coldly.</p>

<p>Petrarch gave vent to his indignation at the papal court in a writing,
entitled, "A Book of Letters without a Title," and in several severe
sonnets. The "Liber Epistolarum sine Titulo" contains, as it is printed
in his works (Basle edit., 1581), eighteen letters, fulminating as
freely against papal luxury and corruption as if they had been penned by
Luther or John Knox. From their contents, we might set down Petrarch as
the earliest preacher of the Reformation, if there were not, in the
writings of Dante, some passages of the same stamp. If these epistles
were really circulated at the time when they were written, it is matter
of astonishment that Petrarch never suffered from any other flames than
those of love; for many honest reformers, who have been roasted alive,
have uttered less anti-papal vituperation than our poet; nor, although
Petrarch would have been startled at a revolution in the hierarchy, can
it be doubted that his writings contributed to the Reformation.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, at the same time, that he wrote against the
church government of Avignon, and not that of Rome. He compares Avignon
with the Assyrian Babylon, with Egypt under the mad tyranny of Cambyses;
or rather, denies that the latter empires can be held as parallels of
guilt to the western Babylon; nay, he tells us that neither Avernus nor
Tartarus can be confronted with this infernal place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span></p>

<p>"The successors of a troop of fishermen," he says, "have forgotten their
origin. They are not contented, like the first followers of Christ, who
gained their livelihood by the Lake of Gennesareth, with modest
habitations, but they must build themselves splendid palaces, and go
about covered with gold and purple. They are fishers of men, who catch a
credulous multitude, and devour them for their prey." This "Liber
Epistolarum" includes some descriptions of the debaucheries of the
churchmen, which are too scandalous for translation. They are
nevertheless curious relics of history.</p>

<p>In this year, Gherardo, the brother of our poet, retired, by his advice,
to the Carthusian monastery of Montrieux, which they had both visited in
the pilgrimage to Baume three years before. Gherardo had been struck
down with affliction by the death of a beautiful woman at Avignon, to
whom he was devoted. Her name and history are quite unknown, but it may
be hoped, if not conjectured, that she was not married, and could be
more liberal in her affections than the poet's Laura.</p>

<p>Amidst all the incidents of this period of his life, the attachment of
Petrarch to Laura continued unabated. It appears, too, that, since his
return from Parma, she treated him with more than wonted complacency. He
passed the greater part of the year 1342 at Avignon, and went to
Vaucluse but seldom and for short intervals.</p>

<p>In the meantime, love, that makes other people idle, interfered not with
Petrarch's fondness for study. He found an opportunity of commencing the
study of Greek, and seized it with avidity. That language had never been
totally extinct in Italy; but at the time on which we are touching,
there were not probably six persons in the whole country acquainted with
it. Dante had quoted Greek authors, but without having known the Greek
alphabet. The person who favoured Petrarch with this coveted instruction
was Bernardo Barlaamo, a Calabrian monk, who had been three years before
at Avignon, having come as envoy from Andronicus, the eastern Emperor,
on pretext of proposing a union between the Greek and Roman churches,
but, in reality for the purpose of trying to borrow money from the Pope
for the Emperor. Some of Petrarch's biographers date his commencement of
the study of Greek from the period of Barlaamo's first visit to Avignon;
but I am inclined to postpone it to 1342, when Barlaamo returned to the
west and settled at Avignon. Petrarch began studying Greek by the
reading of Plato. He never obtained instruction sufficient to make him a
good Grecian, but he imbibed much of the spirit of Plato from the labour
which he bestowed on his works. He was very anxious to continue his
Greek readings with Barlaamo; but his stay in Avignon was very short;
and, though it was his interest to detain him as his preceptor,
Petrarch, finding that he was anxious for a settlement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span> in Italy, helped
him to obtain the bishopric of Geraci, in Calabria.</p>

<p>The next year was memorable in our poet's life for the birth of his
daughter Francesca. That the mother of this daughter was the same who
presented him with his son John there can be no doubt. Baldelli
discovers, in one of Petrarch's letters, an obscure allusion to her,
which seems to indicate that she died suddenly after the birth of
Francesca, who proved a comfort to her father in his old age.</p>

<p>The opening of the year 1343 brought a new loss to Petrarch in the death
of Robert, King of Naples. Petrarch, as we have seen, had occasion to be
grateful to this monarch; and we need not doubt that he was much
affected by the news of his death; but, when we are told that he
repaired to Vaucluse to bewail his irreparable loss, we may suppose,
without uncharitableness, that he retired also with a view to study the
expression of his grief no less than to cherish it. He wrote, however,
an interesting letter on the occasion to Barbato di Sulmona, in which he
very sensibly exhibits his fears of the calamities which were likely to
result from the death of Robert, adding that his mind was seldom true in
prophecy, unless when it foreboded misfortunes; and his predictions on
this occasion were but too well verified.</p>

<p>Robert was succeeded by his granddaughter Giovanna, a girl of sixteen,
already married to Andrew of Hungary, her cousin, who was but a few
months older. Robert by his will had established a council of regency,
which was to continue until Giovanna arrived at the age of twenty-five.
The Pope, however, made objections to this arrangement, alleging that
the administration of affairs during the Queen's minority devolved upon
him immediately as lord superior. But, as he did not choose to assert
his right till he should receive more accurate information respecting
the state of the kingdom, he gave Petrarch a commission for that
purpose; and entrusted him with a negotiation of much importance and
delicacy.</p>

<p>Petrarch received an additional commission from the Cardinal Colonna.
Several friends of the Colonna family were, at that time, confined in
prison at Naples, and the Cardinal flattered himself that Petrarch's
eloquence and intercession would obtain their enlargement. Our poet
accepted the embassy. He went to Nice, where he embarked; but had nearly
been lost in his passage. He wrote to Cardinal Colonna the following
account of his voyage.</p>

<p>"I embarked at Nice, the first maritime town in Italy (he means the
nearest to France). At night I got to Monaco, and the bad weather
obliged me to pass a whole day there, which by no means put me into
good-humour. The next morning we re-embarked, and, after being tossed
all day by the tempest, we arrived very late at Port Maurice. The night
was dreadful; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span> was impossible to get to the castle, and I was obliged
to put up at a little village, where my bed and supper appeared
tolerable from extreme weariness. I determined to proceed by land; the
perils of the road appeared less dreadful to me than those by sea. I
left my servants and baggage in the ship, which set sail, and I remained
with only one domestic on shore. By accident, upon the coast of Genoa, I
found some German horses which were for sale; they were strong and
serviceable. I bought them; but I was soon afterwards obliged to take
ship again; for war was renewed between the Pisans and the Milanese.
Nature has placed limits to these States, the Po on one side, and the
Apennines on the other. I must have passed between their two armies if I
had gone by land; this obliged me to re-embark at Lerici. I passed by
Corvo, that famous rock, the ruins of the city of Luna, and landed at
Murrona. Thence I went the next day on horseback to Pisa, Siena, and
Rome. My eagerness to execute your orders has made me a night-traveller,
contrary to my character and disposition. I would not sleep till I had
paid my duty to your illustrious father, who is always my hero. I found
him the same as I left him seven years ago, nay, even as hale and
sprightly as when I saw him at Avignon, which is now twelve years. What
a surprising man! What strength of mind and body! How firm his voice!
How beautiful his face! Had he been a few years younger, I should have
taken him for Julius C&aelig;sar, or Scipio Africanus. Rome grows old; but not
its hero. He was half undressed, and going to bed; so I stayed only a
moment, but I passed the whole of the next day with him. He asked me a
thousand questions about you, and was much pleased that I was going to
Naples. When I set out from Rome, he insisted on accompanying me beyond
the walls.</p>

<p>"I reached Palestrina that night, and was kindly received by your nephew
John. He is a young man of great hopes, and follows the steps of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>"I arrived at Naples the 11th of October. Heavens, what a change has the
death of one man produced in that place! No one would know it now.
Religion, Justice, and Truth are banished. I think I am at Memphis,
Babylon, or Mecca. In the stead of a king so just and so pious, a little
monk, fat, rosy, barefooted, with a shorn head, and half covered with a
dirty mantle, bent by hypocrisy more than by age, lost in debauchery
whilst proud of his affected poverty, and still more of the real wealth
he has amassed&mdash;this man holds the reins of this staggering empire. In
vice and cruelty he rivals a Dionysius, an Agathocles, or a Phalaris.
This monk, named Roberto, was an Hungarian cordelier, and preceptor of
Prince Andrew, whom he entirely sways. He oppresses the weak, despises
the great, tramples justice under foot, and treats both the dowager and
the reigning Queen with the greatest insolence. The court and city
tremble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span> before him; a mournful silence reigns in the public assemblies,
and in private they converse by whispers. The least gesture is punished,
and <i>to think</i> is denounced as a crime. To this man I have presented the
orders of the Sovereign Pontiff, and your just demands. He behaved with
incredible insolence. Susa, or Damascus, the capital of the Saracens,
would have received with more respect an envoy from the Holy See. The
great lords imitate his pride and tyranny. The Bishop of Cavaillon is
the only one who opposes this torrent; but what can one lamb do in the
midst of so many wolves? It is the request of a dying king alone that
makes him endure so wretched a situation. How small are the hopes of my
negotiation! but I shall wait with patience; though I know beforehand
the answer they will give me."</p>

<p>It is plain from Petrarch's letter that the kingdom of Naples was now
under a miserable subjection to the Hungarian faction, aid that the
young Queen's situation was anything but enviable. Few characters in
modern history have been drawn in such contrasted colours as that of
Giovanna, Queen of Naples. She has been charged with every vice, and
extolled for every virtue. Petrarch represents her as a woman of weak
understanding, disposed to gallantry, but incapable of greater crimes.
Her history reminds us much of that of Mary Queen of Scots. Her youth
and her character, gentle and interesting in several respects, entitle
her to the benefit of our doubts as to her assent to the death of
Andrew. Many circumstances seem to me to favour those doubts, and the
opinion of Petrarch is on the side of her acquittal.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Naples, Petrarch had an audience with the Queen
Dowager; but her grief and tears for the loss of her husband made this
interview brief and fruitless with regard to business. When he spoke to
her about the prisoners, for whose release the Colonnas had desired him
to intercede, her Majesty referred him to the council. She was now, in
reality, only a state cypher.</p>

<p>The principal prisoners for whom Petrarch was commissioned to plead,
were the Counts Minervino, di Lucera, and Pontenza. Petrarch applied to
the council of state in their behalf, but he was put off with perpetual
excuses. While the affair was in agitation he went to Capua, where the
prisoners were confined. "There," he writes to the Cardinal Colonna, "I
saw your friends; and, such is the instability of Fortune, that I found
them in chains. They support their situation with fortitude. Their
innocence is no plea in their behalf to those who have shared in the
spoils of their fortune. Their only expectations rest upon you. I have
no hopes, except from the intervention of some superior power, as any
dependence on the clemency of the council is out of the question. The
Queen Dowager, now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span> most desolate of widows, compassionates their
case, but cannot assist them."</p>

<p>Petrarch, wearied with the delays of business, sought relief in
excursions to the neighbourhood. Of these he writes an account to
Cardinal Colonna.</p>

<p>"I went to Bai&aelig;," he says, "with my friends, Barbato and Barrilli.
Everything concurred to render this jaunt agreeable&mdash;good company, the
beauty of the scenes, and my extreme weariness of the city I had
quitted. This climate, which, as far as I can judge, must be
insupportable in summer, is delightful in winter. I was rejoiced to
behold places described by Virgil, and, what is more surprising, by
Homer before him. I have seen the Lucrine lake, famous for its fine
oysters; the lake Avernus, with water as black as pitch, and fishes of
the same colour swimming in it; marshes formed by the standing waters of
Acheron, and the mountain whose roots go down to hell. The terrible
aspect of this place, the thick shades with which it is covered by a
surrounding wood, and the pestilent odour which this water exhales,
characterize it very justly as the Tartarus of the poets. There wants
only the boat of Charon, which, however, would be unnecessary, as there
is only a shallow ford to pass over. The Styx and the kingdom of Pluto
are now hid from our sight. Awed by what I had heard and read of these
mournful approaches to the dead, I was contented to view them at my feet
from the top of a high mountain. The labourer, the shepherd, and the
sailor, dare not approach them nearer. There are deep caverns, where
some pretend that a great deal of gold is concealed; covetous men, they
say, have been to seek it, but they never return; whether they lost
their way in the dark valleys, or had a fancy to visit the dead, being
so near their habitations.</p>

<p>"I have seen the ruins of the grotto of the famous Cum&aelig;an sybil; it is a
hideous rock, suspended in the Avernian lake. Its situation strikes the
mind with horror. There still remain the hundred mouths by which the
gods conveyed their oracles; these are now dumb, and there is only one
God who speaks in heaven and on earth. These uninhabited ruins serve as
the resort of birds of unlucky omen. Not far off is that dreadful cavern
which leads, <i>they say</i>, to the infernal regions. Who would believe
that, close to the mansions of the dead, Nature should have placed
powerful remedies for the preservation of life? Near Avernus and Acheron
are situated that barren land whence rises continually a salutary
vapour, which is a cure for several diseases, and those hot-springs that
vomit hot and sulphureous cinders. I have seen the baths which Nature
has prepared; but the avarice of physicians has rendered them of
doubtful use. This does not, however, prevent them from being visited by
the invalids of all the neighbouring towns. These hollowed moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>tains
dazzle us with the lustre of their marble circles, on which are engraved
figures that point out, by the position of their hands, the part of the
body which each fountain is proper to cure.</p>

<p>"I saw the foundations of that admirable reservoir of Nero, which was to
go from Mount Misenus to the Avernian lake, and to enclose all the hot
waters of Bai&aelig;.</p>

<p>"At Pozzuoli I saw the mountain of Falernus, celebrated for its grapes,
whence the famous Falernian wine. I saw likewise those enraged waves of
which Virgil speaks in his Georgics, on which C&aelig;sar put a bridle by the
mole which he raised there, and which Augustus finished. It is now
called the Dead Sea. I am surprised at the prodigious expense the Romans
were at to build houses in the most exposed situations, in order to
shelter them from the severities of the weather; for in the heats of
summer the valleys of the Apennines, the mountains of Viterbo, and the
woods of Umbria, furnished them with charming shades; and even the ruins
of the houses which they built in those places are superb."</p>

<p>Our poet's residence at Naples was evidently disagreeable to him, in
spite of the company of his friends, Barrilli and Barbato. His
friendship with the latter was for a moment overcast by an act of
indiscretion on the part of Barbato, who, by dint of importunity,
obtained from Petrarch thirty-four lines of his poem of Africa, under a
promise that he would show them to nobody. On entering the library of
another friend, the first thing that struck our poet's eyes was a copy
of the same verses, transcribed with a good many blunders. Petrarch's
vanity on this occasion, however, was touched more than his anger&mdash;he
forgave his friend's treachery, believing it to have arisen from
excessive admiration. Barbato, as some atonement, gave him a little MS.
of Cicero, which Petrarch found to contain two books of the orator's
Treatise on the Academics, "a work," as he observes, "more subtle than
useful."</p>

<p>Queen Giovanna was fond of literature. She had several conversations
with Petrarch, which increased her admiration of him. After the example
of her grandfather, she made him her chaplain and household clerk, both
of which offices must be supposed to have been sinecures. Her letters
appointing him to them are dated the 25th of November, 1343, the very
day before that nocturnal storm of which I shall speedily quote the
poet's description.</p>

<p>Voltaire has asserted that the young Queen of Naples was the pupil of
Petrarch; "but of this," as De Sade remarks, "there is no proof." It
only appears that the two greatest geniuses of Italy, Boccaccio and
Petrarch, were both attached to Giovanna, and had a more charitable
opinion of her than most of their contemporaries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after his return from the tour to Bai&aelig;, Petrarch was witness to a
violent tempest at Naples, which most historians have mentioned, as it
was memorable for having threatened the entire destruction of the city.</p>

<p>The night of the 25th of November, 1343, set in with uncommonly still
weather; but suddenly a tempest rose violently in the direction of the
sea, which made the buildings of the city shake to their very
foundations. "At the first onset of the tempest," Petrarch writes to the
Cardinal Colonna, "the windows of the house were burst open. The lamp of
my chamber"&mdash;he was lodged at a monastery&mdash;"was blown out&mdash;I was shaken
from my bed with violence, and I apprehended immediate death. The friars
and prior of the convent, who had risen to pay their customary
devotions, rushed into my room with crucifixes and relics in their
hands, imploring the mercy of the Deity. I took courage, and accompanied
them to the church, where we all passed the night, expecting every
moment to be our last. I cannot describe the horrors of that dreadful
night; the bursts of lightning and the roaring of thunder were blended
with the shrieks of the people. The night itself appeared protracted to
an unnatural length; and, when the morning arrived, which we discovered
rather by conjecture than by any dawning of light, the priests prepared
to celebrate the service; but the rest of us, not having yet dared to
lift up our eyes towards the heavens, threw ourselves prostrate on the
ground. At length the day appeared&mdash;a day how like to night! The cries
of the people began to cease in the upper part of the city, but were
redoubled from the sea-shore. Despair inspired us with courage. We
mounted our horses and arrived at the port. What a scene was there! the
vessels had suffered shipwreck in the very harbour; the shore was
covered with dead bodies, which were tossed about and dashed against the
rocks, whilst many appeared struggling in the agonies of death.
Meanwhile, the raging ocean overturned many houses from their very
foundations. Above a thousand Neapolitan horsemen were assembled near
the shore to assist, as it were, at the obsequies of their countrymen. I
caught from them a spirit of resolution, and was less afraid of death
from the consideration that we should all perish together. On a sudden a
cry of horror was heard; the sea had sapped the foundations of the
ground on which we stood, and it was already beginning to give way. We
immediately hastened to a higher place, where the scene was equally
impressive. The young Queen, with naked feet and dishevelled hair,
attended by a number of women, was rushing to the church of the Virgin,
crying out for mercy in this imminent peril. At sea, no ship escaped the
fury of the tempest: all the vessels in the harbour&mdash;one only
excepted&mdash;sunk before our eyes, and every soul on board perished."</p>

<p>By the assiduity and solicitations of Petrarch, the council of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span> Naples
were at last engaged in debating about the liberation of Colonna's
imprisoned friends; and the affair was nearly brought to a conclusion,
when the approach of night obliged the members to separate before they
came to a final decision. The cause of this separation is a sad proof of
Neapolitan barbarism at that period. It will hardly, at this day, seem
credible that, in the capital of so flourishing a kingdom, and the
residence of a brilliant court, such savage licentiousness could have
prevailed. At night, all the streets of the city were beset by the young
nobility, who were armed, and who attacked all passengers without
distinction, so that even the members of the council could not venture
to appear after a certain hour. Neither the severity of parents, nor the
authority of the magistrates, nor of Majesty itself, could prevent
continual combats and assassinations.</p>

<p>"But can it be astonishing," Petrarch remarks, "that such disgraceful
scenes should pass in the night, when the Neapolitans celebrate, even in
the face of day, games similar to those of the gladiators, and with more
than barbarian cruelty? Human blood is shed here with as little remorse
as that of brute animals; and, while the people join madly in applause,
sons expire in the very sight of their parents; and it is considered the
utmost disgrace not to die with becoming fortitude, as if they were
dying in the defence of their religion and country. I myself, ignorant
of these customs was once carried to the Carbonara, the destined place
of butchery. The Queen and her husband, Andrew, were present; the
soldiery of Naples were present, and the people flocked thither in
crowds. I was kept in suspense by the appearance of so large and
brilliant an assembly, and expected some spectacle worthy of my
attention, when I suddenly heard a loud shout of applause, as for some
joyous incident. What was my surprise when I beheld a beautiful young
man pierced through with a sword, and ready to expire at my feet! Struck
with horror, I put spurs to my horse, and fled from the barbarous sight,
uttering execrations on the cruel spectators.</p>

<p>"This inhuman custom has been derived from their ancestors, and is now
so sanctioned by inveterate habit, that their very licentiousness is
dignified with the name of liberty.</p>

<p>"You will cease to wonder at the imprisonment of your friends in this
city, where the death of a young man is considered as an innocent
pastime. As to myself, I will quit this inhuman country before three
days are past, and hasten to you who can make all things agreeable to me
except a sea-voyage."</p>

<p>Petrarch at length brought his negotiations respecting the prisoners to
a successful issue; and they were released by the express authority of
Andrew. Our poet's presence being no longer necessary, he left Naples,
in spite of the strong solicitations of his friends Barrilli and
Barbato. In answer to their request that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span> would remain, he said, "I
am but a satellite, and follow the directions of a superior planet;
quiet and repose are denied to me."</p>

<p>From Naples he went to Parma, where Azzo Correggio, with his wonted
affection, pressed him to delay; and Petrarch accepted the invitation,
though he remarked with sorrow that harmony no longer reigned among the
brothers of the family. He stopped there, however, for some time, and
enjoyed such tranquillity that he could revise and polish his
compositions. But, in the following year, 1345, his friend Azzo, having
failed to keep his promise to Luchino Visconti, as to restoring to him
the lordship of Parma&mdash;Azzo had obtained it by the assistance of the
Visconti, who avenged himself by making war on the Correggios&mdash;he
invested Parma, and afflicted it with a tedious siege. Petrarch,
foreseeing little prospect of pursuing his studies quietly in a
beleaguered city, left the place with a small number of his companions;
but, about midnight, near Rheggio, a troop of robbers rushed from an
ambuscade, with cries of "Kill! kill!" and our handful of travellers,
being no match for a host of brigands, fled and sought to save
themselves under favour of night. Petrarch, during this flight, was
thrown from his horse. The shock was so violent that he swooned; but he
recovered, and was remounted by his companions. They had not got far,
however, when a violent storm of rain and lightning rendered their
situation almost as bad as that from which they had escaped, and
threatened them with death in another shape. They passed a dreadful
night without finding a tree or the hollow of a rock to shelter them,
and had no expedient for mitigating their exposure to the storm but to
turn their horses' backs to the tempest.</p>

<p>When the dawn permitted them to discern a path amidst the brushwood,
they pushed on to Scandiano, a castle occupied by the Gonzaghi, friends
of the lords of Parma, which they happily reached, and where they were
kindly received. Here they learned that a troop of horse and foot had
been waiting for them in ambush near Scandiano, but had been forced by
the bad weather to withdraw before their arrival; thus "<i>the pelting of
the pitiless storm</i>" had been to them a merciful occurrence. Petrarch
made no delay here, for he was smarting under the bruises from his fall,
but caused himself to be tied upon his horse, and went to repose at
Modena. The next day he repaired to Bologna, where he stopped a short
time for surgical assistance, and whence he sent a letter to his friend
Barbato, describing his misadventure; but, unable to hold a pen himself,
he was obliged to employ the hand of a stranger. He was so impatient,
however, to get back to Avignon, that he took the road to it as soon as
he could sit his horse. On approaching that city he says he felt a
greater softness in the air, and saw with delight the flowers that adorn
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span> neighbouring woods. Everything seemed to announce the vicinity of
Laura. It was seldom that Petrarch spoke so complacently of Avignon.</p>

<p>Clement VI. received Petrarch with the highest respect, offered him his
choice among several vacant bishoprics, and pressed him to receive the
office of pontifical secretary. He declined the proffered secretaryship.
Prizing his independence above all things, excepting Laura, he remarked
to his friends that the yoke of office would not sit lighter on him for
being gilded.</p>

<p>In consequence of the dangers he had encountered, a rumour of his death
had spread over a great part of Italy. The age was romantic, with a good
deal of the fantastical in its romance. If the news had been true, and
if he had been really dead and buried, it would be difficult to restrain
a smile at the sort of honours that were paid to his memory by the less
brain-gifted portion of his admirers. One of these, Antonio di Beccaria,
a physician of Ferrara, when he ought to have been mourning for his own
deceased patients, wrote a poetical lamentation for Petrarch's death.
The poem, if it deserve such a name, is allegorical; it represents a
funeral, in which the following personages parade in procession and
grief for the Laureate's death. Grammar, Rhetoric, and Philosophy are
introduced with their several attendants. Under the banners of Rhetoric
are ranged Cicero, Geoffroy de Vinesauf, and Alain de Lisle. It would
require all Cicero's eloquence to persuade us that his comrades in the
procession were quite worthy of his company. The Nine Muses follow
Petrarch's body; eleven poets, crowned with laurel, support the bier,
and Minerva, holding the crown of Petrarch, closes the procession.</p>

<p>We have seen that Petrarch left Naples foreboding disastrous events to
that kingdom. Among these, the assassination of Andrew, on the 18th of
September, 1345, was one that fulfilled his augury. The particulars of
this murder reached Petrarch on his arrival at Avignon, in a letter from
his friend Barbato.</p>

<p>From the sonnets which Petrarch wrote, to all appearance, in 1345 and
1346, at Avignon or Vaucluse, he seems to have suffered from those
fluctuations of Laura's favour that naturally arose from his own
imprudence. When she treated him with affability, he grew bolder in his
assiduities, and she was again obliged to be more severe. See Sonnets
cviii., cix., and cxiv.</p>

<p>During this sojourn, though he dates some of his pleasantest letters
from Vaucluse, he was projecting to return to Italy, and to establish
himself there, after bidding a final adieu to Provence. When he
acquainted his nominal patron, John Colonna, with his intention, the
Cardinal rudely taxed him with madness and ingratitude. Petrarch frankly
told the prelate that he was conscious of no ingratitude, since, after
fourteen years passed in his service, he had received no provision for
his future livelihood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span> This quarrel with the proud churchman is, with
fantastic pastoral imagery, made the subject of our poet's eighth
Bucolic, entitled Divortium. I suspect that Petrarch's free language in
favour of the Tribune Rienzo was not unconnected with their alienation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Petrarch's declared dislike of Avignon, there is every
reason to suppose that he passed the greater part of the winter of 1346
in his western Babylon; and we find that he witnessed many interesting
scenes between the conflicting cardinals, as well as the brilliant f&ecirc;tes
that were given to two foreign princes, whom an important affair now
brought to Avignon. These were the King of Bohemia, and his son Charles,
Prince of Moravia, otherwise called Charles of Luxemburg.</p>

<p>The Emperor Lewis of Bavaria, who had previously made several but
fruitless attempts to reconcile himself with the Church, on learning the
election of Clement VI., sent ambassadors with unlimited powers to
effect a reconcilement; but the Pope proposed conditions so hard and
humbling that the States of the German Empire peremptorily rejected
them. On this, his Holiness confirmed the condemnations which he had
already passed on Lewis of Bavaria, and enjoined the Electors of the
empire to proceed to a new choice of the King of the Romans. "John of
Luxemburg," says Villani, "would have been emperor if he had not been
blind." A wish to secure the empire for his son and to further his
election, brought him to the Pope at Avignon.</p>

<p>Prince Charles had to thank the Pontiff for being elected, but first his
Holiness made him sign, on the 22nd of April, 1346, in presence of
twelve cardinals and his brother William Roger, a declaration of which
the following is the substance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If, by the grace of God, I am elected King of the Romans, I will fulfil
all the promises and confirm all the concessions of my grandfather Henry
VII. and of his predecessors. I will revoke the acts made by Lewis of
Bavaria. I will occupy no place, either in or out of Italy, belonging to
the Church. I will not enter Rome before the day appointed for my
coronation. I will depart from thence the same day with all my
attendants, and I will never return without the permission of the Holy
See." He might as well have declared that he would give the Pope all his
power, as King of the Romans, provided he was allowed the profits; for,
in reality, Charles had no other view with regard to Italy than to make
money.</p>

<p>This concession, which contrasts so poorly with the conduct of Charles
on many other occasions, excited universal indignation in Germany, and a
good deal even in Italy. Petrarch exclaimed against it as mean and
atrocious; for, Catholic as he was, he was not so much a churchman as to
see without indignation the papal tiara exalted above the imperial
crown.</p>

<p>In July, 1346, Charles was elected, and, in derision, was called "the
Emperor of the Priests." The death of his rival, Lewis of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span> Bavaria,
however, which happened in the next year, prevented a civil war, and
Charles IV. remained peaceable possessor of the empire.</p>

<p>Among the f&ecirc;tes that were given to Charles, a ball was held at Avignon,
in a grand saloon brightly illuminated. Thither came all the beauties of
the city and of Provence. The Prince, who had heard much of Laura,
through her poetical fame, sought her out and saluted her in the French
manner.</p>

<p>Petrarch went, according to his custom, to pass the term of Lent at
Vaucluse. The Bishop of Cavaillon, eager to see the poet, persuaded him
to visit his recluse residence, and remained with Petrarch as his guest
for fifteen days, in his own castle, on the summit of rocks, that seemed
more adapted for the perch of birds than the habitation of men. There is
now scarcely a wreck of it remaining.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that the Bishop's conversation made this
retirement very agreeable to Petrarch; for it inspired him with the idea
of writing a "Treatise on a Solitary Life." Of this work he made a
sketch in a short time, but did not finish it till twenty years
afterwards, when he dedicated and presented it to the Bishop of
Cavaillon.</p>

<p>It is agreeable to meet, in Petrarch's life at the shut-up valley, with
any circumstance, however trifling, that indicates a cheerful state of
mind; for, independently of his loneliness, the inextinguishable passion
for Laura never ceased to haunt him; and his love, strange to say, had
mad, momentary hopes, which only deepened at their departure the
returning gloom of despair. Petrarch never wrote more sonnets on his
beloved than during the course of this year. Laura had a fair and
discreet female friend at Avignon, who was also the friend of Petrarch,
and interested in his attachment. The ideas which this amiable
confidante entertained of harmonizing success in misplaced attachment
with honour and virtue must have been Platonic, even beyond the feelings
which Petrarch, in reality, cherished; for, occasionally, the poet's
sonnets are too honest for pure Platonism. This lady, however, whose
name is unknown, strove to convince Laura that she ought to treat her
lover with less severity. "She pushed Laura forward," says De Sade, "and
kept back Petrarch." One day she recounted to the poet all the proofs of
affection, and after these proofs she said, "You infidel, can you doubt
that she loves you?" It is to this fair friend that he is supposed to
have addressed his nineteenth sonnet.</p>

<p>This year, his Laura was seized with a defluxion in her eyes, which made
her suffer much, and even threatened her with blindness. This was enough
to bring a sonnet from Petrarch (his 94th), in which he laments that
those eyes which were the sun of his life should be for ever eclipsed.
He went to see her during her illness, having now the privilege of
visiting her at her own house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span> and one day he found her perfectly
recovered. Whether the ophthalmia was infectious, or only endemic, I
know not; but so it was, that, whilst Laura's eyes got well, those of
her lover became affected with the same defluxion. It struck his
imagination, or, at least, he feigned to believe poetically, that the
malady of her eyes had passed into his; and, in one of his sonnets, he
exults at this welcome circumstance.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> "I fixed my eyes," he said, "on
Laura; and that moment a something inexpressible, like a shooting star,
darted from them to mine. This is a present from love, in which I
rejoice. How delightful it is thus to cure the darling object of one's
soul!"</p>

<p>Petrarch received some show of complacency from Laura, which his
imagination magnified; and it was some sort of consolation, at least,
that his idol was courteous to him; but even this scanty solace was
interrupted. Some malicious person communicated to Laura that Petrarch
was imposing upon her, and that he was secretly addressing his love and
his poetry to another lady under a borrowed name. Laura gave ear to the
calumny, and, for a time, debarred him from her presence. If she had
been wholly indifferent to him, this misunderstanding would have never
existed; for jealousy and indifference are a contradiction in terms. I
mean true jealousy. There is a pseudo species of it, with which many
wives are troubled who care nothing about their husbands' affection; a
plant of ill nature that is reared merely to be a rod of conjugal
castigation. Laura, however, discovered at last, that her admirer was
playing no double part. She was too reasonable to protract so unjust a
quarrel, and received him again as usual.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that Clement VI. had made Petrarch Canon of
Modena, which benefice he resigned in favour of his friend, Luca
Christino, and that this year his Holiness had also conferred upon him
the prebend of Parma. This preferment excited the envy of some persons,
who endeavoured to prejudice Ugolino de' Rossi, the bishop of the
diocese, against him. Ugolino was of that family which had disputed for
the sovereignty of Parma with the Correggios, and against whom Petrarch
had pleaded in favour of their rivals. From this circumstance it was
feared that Ugolino might be inclined to listen to those maligners who
accused Petrarch of having gone to Avignon for the purpose of
undermining the Bishop in the Pope's favour. Petrarch, upon his
promotion, wrote a letter to Ugolino, strongly repelling this
accusation. This is one of the manliest epistles that ever issued from
his pen. "Allow me to assure you," he says, "that I would not exchange
my tranquillity for your troubles, nor my poverty for your riches. Do
not imagine, however, that I despise your particular situation. I only
mean that there is no person of your rank whose preferment I desire; nor
would I accept such prefer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>ment if it were offered to me. I should not
say thus much, if my familiar intercourse with the Pope and the
Cardinals had not convinced me that happiness in that rank is more a
shadow than a substance. It was a memorable saying of Pope Adrian IV.,
'that he knew no one more unhappy than the Sovereign Pontiff; his throne
is a seat of thorns; his mantle is an oppressive weight; his tiara
shines splendidly indeed, but it is not without a devouring fire.' If I
had been ambitious," continues Petrarch, "I might have been preferred to
a benefice of more value than yours;" and he refers to the fact of the
Pope having given him his choice of several high preferments.</p>

<p>Petrarch passed the winter of 1346-47 chiefly at Avignon, and made but
few and short excursions to Vaucluse. In one of these, at the beginning
of 1347, when he had Socrates to keep him company at Vaucluse, the
Bishop of Cavaillon invited them to his castle. Petrarch returned the
following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday we quitted the city of storms to take refuge in this harbour,
and taste the sweets of repose. We have nothing but coarse clothes,
suitable to the season and the place we live in; but in this rustic
dress we will repair to see you, since you command us; we fear not to
present ourselves in this rustic dress; our desire to see you puts down
every other consideration. What matters it to us how we appear before
one who possesses the depth of our hearts? If you wish to see us often
you will treat us without ceremony."</p>

<p>His visits to Vaucluse were rather infrequent; business, he says,
detained him often at Avignon, in spite of himself; but still at
intervals he passed a day or two to look after his gardens and trees. On
one of these occasions, he wrote a pleasing letter to William of
Pastrengo, dilating on the pleasures of his garden, which displays
liveliness and warmth of heart.</p>

<p>Petrarch had not seen his brother since the latter had taken the cowl in
the Carthusian monastery, some five years before. To that convent he
paid a visit in February, 1347, and he was received like an angel from
heaven. He was delighted to see a brother whom he loved so much, and to
find him contented with the life which he had embraced. The Carthusians,
who had heard of Petrarch, renowned as the finest spirit of the age,
were flattered by his showing a strong interest in their condition; and
though he passed but a day and a night with them, they parted so
mutually well pleased, that he promised, on taking leave, to send them a
treatise on the happiness of the life which they led. And he kept his
word; for, immediately upon his return to Vaucluse, he commenced his
essay "<i>De Otio Religioso</i>&mdash;On the Leisure of the Religious," and he
finished it in a few weeks. The object of this work is to show the
sweets and advantages of their retired state, compared with the
agitations of life in the world.</p>

<p>From these monkish reveries Petrarch was awakened by an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span> astounding
public event, namely, the elevation of Cola di Rienzo to the tribuneship
of Rome. At the news of this revolution, Petrarch was animated with as
much enthusiasm as if he had been himself engaged in the enterprise.
Under the first impulse of his feelings, he sent an epistolary
congratulation and advice to Rienzo and the Roman people. This letter
breathes a strongly republican spirit. In later times, we perceive that
Petrarch would have been glad to witness the accomplishment of his
darling object&mdash;Rome restored to her ancient power and magnificence,
even under an imperial government. Our poet received from the Tribune an
answer to his epistolary oration, telling him that it had been read to
the Roman people, and received with applause. A considerable number of
letters passed between Petrarch and Cola.</p>

<p>When we look back on the long connection of Petrarch with the Colonna
family, his acknowledged obligations, and the attachment to them which
he expresses, it may seem, at first sight, surprising that he should
have so loudly applauded a revolution which struck at the roots of their
power. But, if we view the matter with a more considerate eye, we shall
hold the poet in nobler and dearer estimation for his public zeal than
if he had cringed to the Colonnas. His personal attachment to <i>them</i>,
who were quite as much honoured by <i>his</i> friendship as <i>he</i> was by
<i>theirs</i>, was a consideration subservient to that of the honour of his
country and the freedom of his fellow-citizens; "for," as he says in his
own defence, "we owe much to our friends, still more to our parents, but
everything to our country."</p>

<p>Retiring during this year for some time to Vaucluse, Petrarch composed
an eclogue in honour of the Roman revolution, the fifth in his Bucolics.
It is entitled "La Pieta Pastorale," and has three speakers, who
converse about their venerable mother Rome, but in so dull a manner,
that, if Petrarch had never written better poetry, we should not,
probably, at this moment, have heard of his existence.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this political fervour, the poet's devotion to Laura
continued unabated; Petrarch never composed so many sonnets in one year
as during 1347, but, for the most part, still indicative of sadness and
despair. In his 116th sonnet, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Soleo onde, e 'n rena fondo, e serivo in vento."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plough in water, build on sand, and write on air.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If anything were wanting to convince us that Laura had treated him,
during his twenty years' courtship, with sufficient rigour, this and
other such expressions would suffice to prove it. A lover, at the end of
so long a period, is not apt to speak thus despondingly of a mistress
who has been kind to him.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that there were exceptions to her extreme reserve. On
one occasion, this year, when they met, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span> Petrarch's eyes were
fixed on her in silent reverie, she stretched out her hand to him, and
allowed him to detain it in his for some time. This incident is alluded
to in his 218th sonnet.</p>

<p>If public events, however, were not enough to make him forget his
passion for Laura, they were sufficiently stirring to keep his interest
in them alive. The head of Rienzo was not strong enough to stand the
elevation which he had attained. Petrarch had hitherto regarded the
reports of Rienzo's errors as highly exaggerated by his enemies; but the
truth of them, at last, became too palpable; though our poet's
charitable opinion of the Tribune considerably outlasted that of the
public at large.</p>

<p>When the papal court heard of the multiplied extravagances of Rienzo,
they recovered a little from the panic which had seized them. They saw
that they had to deal with a man whose head was turned. His summonses
had enraged them; and they resolved to keep no measures with him.
Towards the end of August, 1347, one of his couriers arrived without
arms, and with only the symbol of his office, the silver rod, in his
hand. He was arrested near Avignon; his letters were taken from him and
torn to pieces; and, without being permitted to enter Avignon, he was
sent back to Rome with threats and ignominy. This proceeding appeared
atrocious in the eyes of Petrarch, and he wrote a letter to Rienzo on
the subject, expressing his strongest indignation at the act of outrage.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

   <span class="caption">COAST OF GENOA.</span>
</div>

<p>Petrarch passed almost the whole of the month of September, 1347, at
Avignon. On the 9th of this month he obtained letters of legitimation
for his son John, who might now be about ten years old. John is
entitled, in these letters, "a scholar of Florence." The Pope empowers
him to possess any kind of benefice without being obliged, in future, to
make mention of his illegitimate birth, or of the obtained dispensation.
It appears from these letters that the mother of John was not married.
He left his son at Verona under the tuition of Rinaldo di Villa Franca.
Before he had left Provence in this year, for the purpose of visiting
Italy, he had announced his intention to the Pope, who wished to retain
him as an honour to his court, and offered him his choice of several
church preferments. But our poet, whose only wish was to obtain some
moderate benefice that would leave him independent and at liberty,
declined his Holiness's <i>vague</i> offers. If we consider that Petrarch
made no secret of his good wishes for Rienzo, it may seem surprisingly
creditable to the Pontiff's liberality that he should have even
<i>professed</i> any interest in the poet's fortune; but in a letter to his
friend Socrates, Petrarch gives us to understand that he thought the
Pope's professions were merely verbal. He says: "To hold out treasures
to a man who demands a small sum is but a polite mode of refusal." In
fact, the Pope offered him <i>some</i> bishopric,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span> knowing that he wanted
only <i>some</i> benefice that should be a sinecure.</p>

<p>If it be asked what determined him now to leave Avignon, the
counter-question may be put, what detained him so long from Italy? It
appears that he had never parted with his house and garden at Parma; he
hated everything in Avignon excepting Laura; and of the solitude of
Vaucluse he was, in all probability, already weary.</p>

<p>Before he left Avignon, he went to take leave of Laura. He found her at
an assembly which she often frequented. "She was seated," he says,
"among those ladies who are generally her companions, and appeared like
a beautiful rose surrounded with flowers smaller and less blooming." Her
air was more touching than usual. She was dressed perfectly plain, and
without pearls or garlands, or any gay colour. Though she was not
melancholy, she did not appear to have her wonted cheerfulness, but was
serious and thoughtful. She did not sing, as usual, nor speak with that
voice which used to charm every one. She had the air of a person who
fears an evil not yet arrived. "In taking leave of her," says Petrarch,
"I sought in her looks for a consolation of my own sufferings. Her eyes
had an expression which I had never seen in them before. What I saw in
her face seemed to predict the sorrows that threatened me."</p>

<p>This was the last meeting that Petrarch and Laura ever had.</p>

<p>Petrarch set out for Italy, towards the close of 1347, having determined
to make that country his residence for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at Genoa he wrote to Rienzo, reproaching him for his
follies, and exhorting him to return to his former manly conduct. This
advice, it is scarcely necessary to say, was like dew and sunshine
bestowed upon barren sands.</p>

<p>From Genoa he proceeded to Parma, where he received the first
information of the catastrophe of the Colonna family, six of whom had
fallen in battle with Rienzo's forces. He showed himself deeply affected
by it, and, probably, was so sincerely. But the Colonnas, though his
former patrons, were still the enemies of a cause which he considered
sacred, much as it was mismanaged and disgraced by the Tribune; and his
grief cannot be supposed to have been immoderate. Accordingly, the
letter which he wrote to Cardinal Colonna on this occasion is quite in
the style of Seneca, and more like an ethical treatise than an epistle
of condolence.</p>

<p>It is obvious that Petrarch slowly and reluctantly parted with his good
opinion of Rienzo. But, whatever sentiments he might have cherished
respecting him, he was now doomed to hear of his tragic fall.</p>

<p>The revolution which overthrew the Tribune was accomplished on the 15th
of December, 1347. That his fall was, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span> considerable degree, owing
to his faults, is undeniable; and to the most contemptible of all
faults&mdash;personal vanity. How hard it is on the great mass of mankind,
that this meanness is so seldom disjoined from the zeal of popular
championship! New power, like new wine, seems to intoxicate the
strongest heads. How disgusting it is to see the restorer of Roman
liberty dazzled like a child by a scarlet robe and its golden trimming!
Nevertheless, with all his vanity, Rienzo was a better friend to the
republic than those who dethroned him. The Romans would have been wise
to have supported Rienzo, taking even his foibles into the account. They
re-admitted their oligarchs; and, if they repented of it, as they did,
they are scarcely entitled to our commiseration.</p>

<p>Petrarch had set out late in 1347 to visit Italy for the fifth time. He
arrived at Genoa towards the end of November, 1347, on his way to
Florence, where he was eagerly expected by his friends. They had
obtained from the Government permission for his return; and he was
absolved from the sentence of banishment in which he had been included
with his father. But, whether Petrarch was offended with the Florentines
for refusing to restore his paternal estate, or whether he was detained
by accident in Lombardy, he put off his expedition to Florence and
repaired to Parma. It was there that he learned the certainty of the
Tribune's fall.</p>

<p>From Parma he went to Verona, where he arrived on the evening of the
25th of January, 1348. His son, we have already mentioned, was placed at
Verona, under the tuition of Rinaldo di Villa Franca. Here, soon after
his arrival, as he was sitting among his books, Petrarch felt the shock
of a tremendous earthquake. It seemed as if the whole city was to be
overturned from its foundations. He rushed immediately into the streets,
where the inhabitants were gathered together in consternation; and,
whilst terror was depicted in every countenance, there was a general cry
that the end of the world was come. All contemporary historians mention
this earthquake, and agree that it originated at the foot of the Alps.
It made sad ravages at Pisa, Bologna, Padua, and Venice, and still more
in the Frioul and Bavaria. If we may trust the narrators of this event,
sixty villages in one canton were buried under two mountains that fell
and filled up a valley five leagues in length. A whole castle, it is
added, was exploded out of the earth from its foundation, and its ruins
scattered many miles from the spot. The latter anecdote has undoubtedly
an air of the marvellous; and yet the convulsions of nature have
produced equally strange effects. Stones have been thrown out of Mount
&AElig;tna to the distance of eighteen miles.</p>

<p>The earthquake was the forerunner of awful calamities; and it is
possible that it might be physically connected with that memo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>rable
plague in 1348, which reached, in succession, all parts of the known
world, and thinned the population of every country which it visited.
Historians generally agree that this great plague began in China and
Tartary, whence, in the space of a year, it spread its desolation over
the whole of Asia. It extended itself over Italy early in 1348; but its
severest ravages had not yet been made, when Petrarch returned from
Verona to Parma in the month of March, 1348. He brought with him his son
John, whom he had withdrawn from the school of Rinaldo di Villa Franca,
and placed under Gilberto di Parma, a good grammarian. His motive for
this change of tutorship probably was, that he reckoned on Parma being
henceforward his own principal place of residence, and his wish to have
his son beside him.</p>

<p>Petrarch had scarcely arrived at Parma when he received a letter from
Luchino Visconti, who had lately received the lordship of that city.
Hearing of Petrarch's arrival there, the Prince, being at Milan, wrote
to the poet, requesting some orange plants from his garden, together
with a copy of verses. Petrarch sent him both, accompanied with a
letter, in which he praises Luchino for his encouragement of learning
and his cultivation of the Muses.</p>

<p>The plague was now increasing in Italy; and, after it had deprived
Petrarch of many dear friends, it struck at the root of all his
affections by attacking Laura. He describes his apprehensions on this
occasion in several of his sonnets. The event confirmed his melancholy
presages; for a letter from his friend Socrates informed him that Laura
had died of the plague on the 1st of April, 1348. His biographers may
well be believed, when they tell us that his grief was extreme. Laura's
husband took the event more quietly, and consoled himself by marrying
again, when only seven months a widower.</p>

<p>Petrarch, when informed of her death, wrote that marginal note upon his
copy of Virgil, the authenticity of which has been so often, though
unjustly, called in question. His words were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Laura, illustrious for her virtues, and for a long time celebrated in
my verses, for the first time appeared to my eyes on the 6th of April,
1327, in the church of St. Clara, at the first hour of the day. I was
then in my youth. In the same city, and at the same hour, in the year
1348, this luminary disappeared from our world. I was then at Verona,
ignorant of my wretched situation. Her chaste and beautiful body was
buried the same day, after vespers, in the church of the Cordeliers. Her
soul returned to its native mansion in heaven. I have written this with
a pleasure mixed with bitterness, to retrace the melancholy remembrance
of '<span class="smcap">my great loss</span>.' This loss convinces me that I have nothing
now left worth living for, since the strongest cord of my life is
broken. By the grace of God, I shall easily renounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span> a world where my
hopes have been vain and perishing. It is time for me to fly from
Babylon when the knot that bound me to it is untied."</p>

<p>This copy of Virgil is famous, also, for a miniature picture expressing
the subject of the &AElig;neid; which, by the common consent of connoisseurs
in painting, is the work of Simone Memmi. Mention has already been made
of the friendly terms that subsisted between that painter and our poet;
whence it may be concluded that Petrarch, who received this precious MS.
in 1338, requested of Simone this mark of his friendship, to render it
more valuable.</p>

<p>When the library of Pavia, together with the city, was plundered by the
French in 1499, and when many MSS. were carried away to the library of
Paris, a certain inhabitant of Pavia had the address to snatch this copy
of Virgil from the general rapine. This individual was, probably,
Antonio di Pirro, in whose hands or house the Virgil continued till the
beginning of the sixteenth century, as Vellutello attests in his article
on the origin of Laura. From him it passed to Antonio Agostino;
afterwards to Fulvio Orsino, who prized it very dearly. At Orsino's
death it was bought at a high price by Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, and
placed in the Ambrosian library, which had been founded by him with much
care and at vast expense.</p>

<p>Until the year 1795, this copy of Virgil was celebrated only on account
of the memorandum already quoted, and a few short marginal notes,
written for illustrations of the text; but, a part of the same leaf
having been torn and detached from the cover, the librarians, by chance,
perceived some written characters. Curiosity urged them to unglue it
with the greatest care; but the parchment was so conglutinated with the
board that the letters left their impression on the latter so palely and
weakly, that the librarians had great difficulty in making out the
following notice, written by Petrarch himself: "Liber hic furto mihi
subreptus fuerat, anno domini mcccxxvi., in Kalend. Novembr., ac deinde
restitutus, anno mcccxxxvii., die xvii. Aprilis, apud Aivin<sup>o</sup>."</p>

<p>Then follows a note by the poet himself, regarding his son: "Johannes
noster, natus ad laborem et dolorem meum, et vivens gravibus atque
perpetuis me curis exercuit, et acri dolore moriens vulneravit, qui cum

to the death of other friends; but the entire note is too long to be
quoted, and, in many places, is obscured by contractions which make its
meaning doubtful.</p>

<p>The perfect accordance of these memoranda with the other writings of the
poet, conjoined with historical facts, show them incontestably to have
come from the hand of Petrarch.</p>

<p>The precious MS. of Virgil, containing the autograph of Petrarch, is no
longer in Italy. Like many other relics held sacred by the Italians, it
was removed by the French during the last conquest of Italy.</p>

<p>Among the incidents of Petrarch's life, in 1348, we ought to notice his
visits to Giacomo da Carrara, whose family had supplanted the Della
Scalas at Padua, and to Manfredi Pio, the Padrone of Carpi, a beautiful
little city, of the Modenese territory, situated on a fine plain, on the
banks of the Secchio, about four miles from Correggio. Manfredi ruled it
with reputation for twenty years. Petrarch was magnificently received by
the Carraras; and, within two years afterwards, they bestowed upon him
the canonicate of Padua, a promotion which was followed in the same year
by his appointment to the archdeaconry of Parma, of which he had been
hitherto only canon.</p>

<p>Not long after the death of Laura, on the 3rd of July of the same year,
Petrarch lost Cardinal Colonna, who had been for so many years his
friend and patron. By some historians it is said that this prelate died
of the plague; but Petrarch thought that he sank under grief brought on
by the disasters of his family. In the space of five years the Cardinal
had lost his mother and six brothers.</p>

<p>Petrarch still maintained an interest in the Colonna family, though that
interest was against his own political principles, during the good
behaviour of the Tribune. After the folly and fall of Rienzo, it is
probable that our poet's attachment to his old friends of the Roman
aristocracy revived. At least, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span> thought it decent to write, on the
death of Cardinal Colonna, a letter of condolence to his father, the
aged Stefano, who was now verging towards his hundredth year. Soon after
this letter reached him, old Stefano fell into the grave.</p>

<p>The death of Cardinal Colonna was extremely felt at Avignon, where it
left a great void, his house having been the rendezvous of men of
letters and genius. Those who composed his court could not endure
Avignon after they had lost their M&aelig;cenas. Three of them were the
particular friends of Petrarch, namely, Socrates, Luca Christine and
Mainardo Accursio. Socrates, though not an Italian, was extremely
embarrassed by the death of the Cardinal. He felt it difficult to live
separated from Petrarch, and yet he could not determine to quit France
for Italy. He wrote incessantly the most pressing letters to induce our
poet to return and settle in Provence. Luca and Mainardo resolved to go
and seek out Petrarch in Italy, in order to settle with him the place on
which they should fix for their common residence, and where they should
spend the rest of their lives in his society. They set out from Avignon
in the month of March, 1349, and arrived at Parma, but did not find the
poet, as he was gone on an excursion to Padua and Verona. They passed a
day in his house to rest themselves, and, when they went away, left a
letter in his library, telling him they had crossed the Alps to come and
see him, but that, having missed him, as soon as they had finished an
excursion which they meant to make, they would return and settle with
him the means of their living together. Petrarch, on his return to
Parma, wrote several interesting letters to Mainardo. In one of them he
says, "I was much grieved that I had lost the pleasure of your company,
and that of our worthy friend, Luca Christino. However, I am not without
the consoling hope that my absence may be the means of hastening your
return. As to your apprehensions about my returning to Vaucluse, I
cannot deny that, at the entreaties of Socrates, I should return,
provided I could procure an establishment in Provence, which would
afford me an honourable pretence for residing there, and, at the same
time, enable me to receive my friends with hospitality; but at present
circumstances are changed. The Cardinal Colonna is dead, and my friends
are all dispersed, excepting Socrates, who continues inviolably attached
to Avignon.</p>

<p>"As to Vaucluse, I well know the beauties of that charming valley, and
ten years' residence is a proof of my affection for the place. I have
shown my love of it by the house which I built there. There I began my
Africa, there I wrote the greater part of my epistles in prose and
verse, and there I nearly finished all my eclogues. I never had so much
leisure, nor felt so much enthusiasm, in any other spot. At Vaucluse I
conceived the first idea of giving an epitome of the Lives of
Illustrious Men, and there I wrote my Treatise on a Solitary Life, as
well as that on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span> religious retirement. It was there, also, that I sought
to moderate my passion for Laura, which, alas, solitude only cherished.
In short, this lonely valley will for ever be pleasing to my
recollections. There is, nevertheless, a sad change, produced by time.
Both the Cardinal and everything that is dear to me have perished. The
veil which covered my eyes is at length removed. I can now perceive the
difference between Vaucluse and the rich mountains and vales and
flourishing cities of Italy. And yet, forgive me, so strong are the
prepossessions of youth, that I must confess I pine for Vaucluse, even
whilst I acknowledge its inferiority to Italy."</p>

<p>Whilst Petrarch was thus flattering his imagination with hopes that were
never to be realized, his two friends, who had proceeded to cross the
Apennines, came to an untimely fate. On the 5th of June, 1349, a
servant, whom Petrarch had sent to inquire about some alarming accounts
of the travellers that had gone abroad, returned sooner than he was
expected, and showed by his face that he brought no pleasant tidings.
Petrarch was writing&mdash;the pen fell from his hand. "What news do you
bring?" "Very bad news! Your two friends, in crossing the Apennines,
were attacked by robbers." "O God! what has happened to them?" The
messenger replied, "Mainardo, who was behind his companions, was
surrounded and murdered. Luca, hearing of his fate, came back sword in
hand. He fought alone against ten, and he wounded some of the
assailants, but at last he received many wounds, of which he lies almost
dead. The robbers fled with their booty. The peasants assembled, and
pursued, and would have captured them, if some gentlemen, unworthy of
being called so, had not stopped the pursuit, and received the villains
into their castles. Luca was seen among the rocks, but no one knows what
is become of him." Petrarch, in the deepest agitation, despatched fleet
couriers to Placenza, to Florence, and to Rome, to obtain intelligence
about Luca.</p>

<p>These ruffians, who came from Florence, were protected by the Ubaldini,
one of the most powerful and ancient families in Tuscany. As the murder
was perpetrated within the territory of Florence, Petrarch wrote
indignantly to the magistrates and people of that State, intreating them
to avenge an outrage on their fellow citizens. Luca, it appears, expired
of his wounds.</p>

<p>Petrarch's letter had its full effect. The Florentine commonwealth
despatched soldiers, both horse and foot, against the Ubaldini and their
banditti, and decreed that every year an expedition should be sent out
against them till they should be routed out of their Alpine caverns. The
Florentine troops directed their march to Monte Gemmoli, an almost
impregnable rock, which they blockaded and besieged. The banditti issued
forth from their strongholds, and skirmished with overmuch confidence in
their vantage ground. At this crisis, the Florentine cavalry, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
ascended the hill, dismounted from their horses, pushed forward on the
banditti before they could retreat into their fortress, and drove them,
sword in hand, within its inmost circle. The Florentines thus possessed
themselves of Monte Gemmoli, and, in like manner, of several other
strongholds. There were others which they could not take by storm, but
they laid waste the plains and cities which supplied the robbers with
provisions; and, after having done great damage to the Ubaldini, they
returned safe and sound to Florence.</p>

<p>While Petrarch was at Mantua, in February, 1350, the Cardinal Guy of
Boulogne, legate of the holy see, arrived there after a papal mission to
Hungary. Petrarch was much attached to him. The Cardinal and several
eminent persons who attended him had frequent conversations with our
poet, in which they described to him the state of Germany and the
situation of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Clement VI., who had reason to be satisfied with the submissiveness of
this Prince, wished to attract him into Italy, where he hoped to oppose
him to the Visconti, who had put themselves at the head of the Ghibeline
party, and gave much annoyance to the Guelphs. His Holiness strongly
solicited him to come; but Charles's situation would not permit him for
the present to undertake such an expedition. There were still some
troubles in Germany that remained to be appeased; besides, the Prince's
purse was exhausted by the largesses which he had paid for his election,
and his poverty was extreme.</p>

<p>It must be owned that a prince in such circumstances could hardly be
expected to set out for the subjugation of Italy. Petrarch, however,
took a romantic view of the Emperor's duties, and thought that the
restoration of the Roman empire was within Charles's grasp. Our poet
never lost sight of his favourite chimera, the re-establishment of Rome
in her ancient dominion. It was what he called one of his principles,
that Rome had a right to govern the world. Wild as this vision was, he
had seen Rienzo attempt its realization; and, if the Tribune had been
more prudent, there is no saying how nearly he might have approached to
the achievement of so marvellous an issue. But Rienzo was fallen
irrecoverably, and Petrarch now desired as ardently to see the Emperor
in Italy, as ever he had sighed for the success of the Tribune. He wrote
to the Emperor a long letter from Padua, a few days after the departure
of the Cardinal.</p>

<p>"I am agitated," he says, "in sending this epistle, when I think from
whom it comes, and to whom it is addressed. Placed as I am, in
obscurity, I am dazzled by the splendour of your name; but love has
banished fear: this letter will at least make known to you my fidelity,
and my zeal. Read it, I conjure you! You will not find in it the insipid
adulation which is the plague of monarchs. Flattery is an art unknown to
me. I have to offer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span> you only complaints and regrets. You have forgotten
us. I say more&mdash;you have forgotten yourself in neglecting Italy. We had
high hopes that Heaven had sent you to restore us our liberty; but it
seems that you refuse this mission, and, whilst the time should be spent
in acting, you lose it in deliberating.</p>

<p>"You see, C&aelig;sar, with what confidence an obscure man addresses you, a
man who has not even the advantage of being known to you. But, far from
being offended with the liberty I take, you ought rather to thank your
own character, which inspires me with such confidence. To return to my
subject&mdash;wherefore do you lose time in consultation? To all appearance,
you are sure of the future, if you will avail yourself of the present.
You cannot be ignorant that the success of great affairs often hangs
upon an instant, and that a day has been frequently sufficient to
consummate what it required ages to undo. Believe me, your glory and the
safety of the commonwealth, your own interests, as well as ours, require
that there be no delay. You are still young, but time is flying; and old
age will come and take you by surprise when you are at least expecting
it. Are you afraid of too soon commencing an enterprise for which a long
life would scarcely suffice?</p>

<p>"The Roman empire, shaken by a thousand storms, and as often deceived by
fallacious calms, places at last its whole hopes in you. It recovers a
little breath even under the shelter of your name; but hope alone will
not support it. In proportion as you know the grandeur of the
undertaking, consummate it the sooner. Let not the love of your
Transalpine dominions detain you longer. In beholding Germany, think of
Italy. If the one has given you birth, the other has given you
greatness. If you are king of the one, you are king and emperor of the
other. Let me say, without meaning offence to other nations, that here
is the head of your monarchy. Everywhere else you will find only its
members. What a glorious project to unite those members to their head!</p>

<p>"I am aware that you dislike all innovation; but what I propose would be
no innovation on your part. Italy is as well known to you as Germany.
Brought hither in your youth by your illustrious sire, he made you
acquainted with our cities and our manners, and taught you here the
first lessons of war. In the bloom of your youth, you have obtained
great victories. Can you fear at present to enter a country where you
have triumphed since your childhood?</p>

<p>"By the singular favour of Heaven we have regained the ancient right of
being governed by a prince of our own nation.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> Let Germany say what
she will, Italy is veritably your country * * * * * Come with haste to
restore peace to Italy. Behold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span> Rome, once the empress of the world, now
pale, with scattered locks and torn garments, at your feet, imploring
your presence and support!" Then follows a dissertation on the history
and heroes of Rome, which might be wearisome if transcribed to a modern
reader. But the epistle, upon the whole, is manly and eloquent.</p>

<p>A few days after despatching his letter to the Emperor, Petrarch made a
journey to Verona to see his friends. There he wrote to Socrates. In
this letter, after enumerating the few friends whom the plague had
spared, he confesses that he could not flatter himself with the hope of
being able to join them in Provence. He therefore invokes them to come
to Italy, and to settle either at Parma or at Padua, or any other place
that would suit them. His remaining friends, here enumerated, were only
Barbato of Sulmona, Francesco Rinucci, John Boccaccio, L&aelig;lius, Guido
Settimo, and Socrates.</p>

<p>Petrarch had returned to Padua, there to rejoin the Cardinal of
Boulogne. The Cardinal came back thither at the end of April, 1350, and,
after dispensing his blessings, spiritual and temporal, set out for
Avignon, travelling by way of Milan and Genoa. Petrarch accompanied the
prelate out of personal attachment on a part of his journey. The
Cardinal was fond of his conversation, but sometimes rallied the poet on
his enthusiasm for his native Italy. When they reached the territory of
Verona, near the lake of Guarda, they were struck by the beauty of the
prospect, and stopped to contemplate it. In the distance were the Alps,
topped with snow even in summer. Beneath was the lake of Guarda, with
its flux and reflux, like the sea, and around them were the rich hills
and fertile valleys. "It must be confessed," said the Legate to
Petrarch, "that your country is more beautiful than ours." The face of
Petrarch brightened up. "But you must agree," continued the Cardinal,
perhaps to moderate the poet's exultation, "that ours is more tranquil."
"That is true," replied Petrarch, "but we can obtain tranquillity
whenever we choose to come to our senses, and desire peace, whereas you
cannot procure those beauties which nature has lavished <i>on us</i>."</p>

<p>Petrarch here took leave of the Cardinal, and set out for Parma. Taking
Mantua in his way, he set out from thence in the evening, in order to
sleep at Luzora, five leagues from the Po. The lords of that city had
sent a courier to Mantua, desiring that he would honour them with his
presence at supper. The melting snows and the overflowing river had made
the roads nearly impassable; but he reached the place in time to avail
himself of the invitation. His hosts gave him a magnificent reception.
The supper was exquisite, the dishes rare, the wines delicious, and the
company full of gaiety. But a small matter, however, will spoil the
finest feast. The supper was served up in a damp, low hall, and all
sorts of insects annoyed the convivials. To crown their misfor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>tune an
army of frogs, attracted, no doubt, by the odour of the meats, crowded
and croaked about them, till they were obliged to leave their unfinished
supper.</p>

<p>Petrarch returned next day for Parma. We find, from the original
fragments of his poems, brought to light by Ubaldini, that he was
occupied in retouching them during the summer which he passed at Parma,
waiting for the termination of the excessive heats, to go to Rome and
attend the jubilee. With a view to make the journey pleasanter, he
invited Guglielmo di Pastrengo to accompany him, in a letter written in
Latin verse. Nothing would have delighted Guglielmo more than a journey
to Rome with Petrarch; but he was settled at Verona, and could not
absent himself from his family.</p>

<p>In lieu of Pastrengo, Petrarch found a respectable old abbot, and
several others who were capable of being agreeable, and from their
experience, useful companions to him on the road. In the middle of
October, 1350, they departed from Florence for Rome, to attend the
jubilee. On his way between Bolsena and Viterbo, he met with an accident
which threatened dangerous consequences, and which he relates in a
letter to Boccaccio.</p>

<p>"On the 15th of October," he says, "we left Bolsena, a little town
scarcely known at present; but interesting from having been anciently
one of the principal places in Etruria. Occupied with the hopes of
seeing Rome in five days, I reflected on the changes in our modes of
thinking which are made by the course of years. Fourteen years ago I
repaired to the great city from sheer curiosity to see its wonders. The
second time I came was to receive the laurel. My third and fourth
journey had no object but to render services to my persecuted friends.
My present visit ought to be more happy, since its only object is my
eternal salvation." It appears, however, that the horses of the
travellers had no such devotional feelings; "for," he continues, "whilst
my mind was full of these thoughts, the horse of the old abbot, which
was walking upon my left, kicking at my horse, struck me upon the leg,
just below the knee. The blow was so violent that it sounded as if a
bone was broken. My attendants came up. I felt an acute pain, which made
me, at first, desirous of stopping; but, fearing the dangerousness of
the place, I made a virtue of necessity, and went on to Viterbo, where
we arrived very late on the 16th of October. Three days afterwards they
dragged me to Rome with much trouble. As soon as I arrived at Rome, I
called for doctors, who found the bone laid bare. It was not, however,
thought to be broken; though the shoe of the horse had left its
impression."</p>

<p>However impatient Petrarch might be to look once more on the beauties of
Rome, and to join in the jubilee, he was obliged to keep his bed for
many days.</p>

<p>The concourse of pilgrims to this jubilee was immense. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span> can scarcely
credit the common account that there were about a million pilgrims at
one time assembled in the great city. "We do not perceive," says
Petrarch, "that the plague has depopulated the world." And, indeed, if
this computation of the congregated pilgrims approaches the truth, we
cannot but suspect that the alleged depopulation of Europe, already
mentioned, must have been exaggerated. "The crowds," he continues,
"diminished a little during summer and the gathering-in of the harvest;
but recommenced towards the end of the year. The great nobles and ladies
from beyond the Alps came the last."</p>

   <span class="caption">BRIDGE OF SIGHS,&mdash;VENICE.</span>
</div>

<p>Many of the female pilgrims arrived by way of the marshes of Ancona,
where Bernardino di Roberto, Lord of Ravenna, waited for them, and
scandal whispered that his assiduities and those of his suite were but
too successful in seducing them. A contemporary author, in allusion to
the circumstance, remarks that journeys and indulgences are not good for
young persons, and that the fair ones had better have remained at home,
since the vessel that stays in port is never shipwrecked.</p>

<p>The strangers, who came from all countries, were for the most part
unacquainted with the Italian language, and were obliged to employ
interpreters in making their confession, for the sake of obtaining
absolution. It was found that many of the pretended interpreters were
either imperfectly acquainted with the language of the foreigners, or
were knaves in collusion with the priestly confessors, who made the poor
pilgrims confess whatever they chose, and pay for their sins
accordingly. A better subject for a scene in comedy could scarcely be
imagined. But, to remedy this abuse, penitentiaries were established at
Rome, in which the confessors understood foreign languages.</p>

<p>The number of days fixed for the Roman pilgrims to visit the churches
was thirty; and fifteen or ten for the Italians and other strangers,
according to the distance of the places from which they came.</p>

<p>Petrarch says that it is inconceivable how the city of Rome, whose
adjacent fields were untilled, and whose vineyards had been frozen the
year before, could for twelve months support such a confluence of
people. He extols the hospitality of the citizens, and the abundance of
food which prevailed; but Villani and others give us more disagreeable
accounts&mdash;namely, that the Roman citizens became hotel-keepers, and
charged exorbitantly for lodgings, and for whatever they sold. Numbers
of pilgrims were thus necessitated to live poorly; and this, added to
their fatigue and the heats of summer, produced a great mortality.</p>

<p>As soon as Petrarch, relieved by surgical skill from the wound in his
leg, was allowed to go out, he visited all the churches.</p>

<p>After having performed his duties at the jubilee, Petrarch returned to
Padua, taking the road by Arezzo, the town which had the honour of his
birth. Leonardo Aretino says that his fellow-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>townsmen crowded around
him with delight, and received him with such honours as could have been
paid only to a king.</p>

<p>In the same month of December, 1350, he discovered a treasure which made
him happier than a king. Perhaps a royal head might not have equally
valued it. It was a copy of Quintilian's work "De Institutione
Oratoria," which, till then, had escaped all his researches. On the very
day of the discovery he wrote a letter to Quintilian, according to his
fantastic custom of epistolizing the ancients. Some days afterwards, he
left Arezzo to pursue his journey. The principal persons of the town
took leave of him publicly at his departure, after pointing out to him
the house in which he was born. "It was a small house," says Petrarch,
"befitting an exile, as my father was." They told him that the
proprietors would have made some alterations in it; but the town had
interposed and prevented them, determined that the place should remain
the same as when it was first consecrated by his birth. The poet related
what had been mentioned to a young man who wrote to him expressly to ask
whether Arezzo could really boast of being his birthplace. Petrarch
added, that Arezzo had done more for him as a stranger than Florence as
a citizen. In truth, his family was of Florence; and it was only by
accident that he was born at Arezzo. He then went to Florence, where he
made but a short stay. There he found his friends still alarmed about
the accident which had befallen him in his journey to Rome, the news of
which he had communicated to Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Petrarch went on to Padua. On approaching it, he perceived a universal
mourning. He soon learned the foul catastrophe which had deprived the
city of one of its best masters.</p>

<p>Jacopo di Carrara had received into his house his cousin Guglielmo.
Though the latter was known to be an evil-disposed person, he was
treated with kindness by Jacopo, and ate at his table. On the 21st of
December, whilst Jacopo was sitting at supper, in the midst of his
friends, his people and his guards, the monster Guglielmo plunged a
dagger into his breast with such celerity, that even those who were
nearest could not ward off the blow. Horror-struck, they lifted him up,
whilst others put the assassin to instant death.</p>

<p>The fate of Jacopo Carrara gave Petrarch a dislike for Padua, and his
recollections of Vaucluse bent his unsettled mind to return to its
solitude; but he tarried at Padua during the winter. Here he spent a
great deal of his time with Ildebrando Conti, bishop of that city, a man
of rank and merit. One day, as he was dining at the Bishop's palace, two
Carthusian monks were announced: they were well received by the Bishop,
as he was partial to their order. He asked them what brought them to
Padua. "We are going," they said, "to Treviso, by the direction of our
general, there to remain and establish a monastery." Ilde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span>brando asked
if they knew Father Gherardo, Petrarch's brother. The two monks, who did
not know the poet, gave the most pleasing accounts of his brother.</p>

<p>The plague, they said, having got into the convent of Montrieux, the
prior, a pious but timorous man, told his monks that flight was the only
course which they could take: Gherardo answered with courage, "Go
whither you please! As for myself I will remain in the situation in
which Heaven has placed me." The prior fled to his own country, where
death soon overtook him. Gherardo remained in the convent, where the
plague spared him, and left him alone, after having destroyed, within a
few days, thirty-four of the brethren who had continued with him. He
paid them every service, received their last sighs, and buried them when
death had taken off those to whom that office belonged. With only a dog
left for his companion, Gherardo watched at night to guard the house,
and took his repose by day. When the summer was over, he went to a
neighbouring monastery of the Carthusians, who enabled him to restore
his convent.</p>

<p>While the Carthusians were making this honourable mention of Father
Gherardo, the prelate cast his eyes from time to time upon Petrarch. "I
know not," says the poet, "whether my eyes were filled with tears, but
my heart was tenderly touched." The Carthusians, at last discovering who
Petrarch was, saluted him with congratulations. Petrarch gives an
account of this interview in a letter to his brother himself.</p>

<p>Padua was too near to Venice for Petrarch not to visit now and then that
city which he called the wonder of the world. He there made acquaintance
with Andrea Dandolo, who was made Doge in 1343, though he was only
thirty-six years of age, an extraordinary elevation for so young a man;
but he possessed extraordinary merit. His mind was cultivated; he loved
literature, and easily became, as far as mutual demonstrations went, the
personal friend of Petrarch; though the Doge, as we shall see, excluded
this personal friendship from all influence on his political conduct.</p>

<p>The commerce of the Venetians made great progress under the Dogeship of
Andrea Dandolo. It was then that they began to trade with Egypt and
Syria, whence they brought silk, pearls, the spices, and other products
of the East. This prosperity excited the jealousy of the Genoese, as it
interfered with a commerce which they had hitherto monopolized. When the
Venetians had been chased from Constantinople by the Emperor Michael
Paleologus, they retained several fortresses in the Black Sea, which
enabled them to continue their trade with the Tartars in that sea, and
to frequent the fair of Tana. The Genoese, who were masters of Pera, a
suburb of Constantinople, would willingly have joined the Greeks in
expelling their Italian rivals altogether from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span> Black Sea; and
privateering hostilities actually commenced between the two republics,
which, in 1350, extended to the serious aspect of a national war.</p>

<p>The winter of that year was passed on both sides in preparations. The
Venetians sent ambassadors to the King of Arragon, who had some
differences with the Genoese about the Island of Sardinia, and to the
Emperor of Constantinople, who saw with any sensation in the world but
delight the flag of Genoa flying over the walls of Pera. A league
between those three powers was quickly concluded, and their grand,
common object was to destroy the city of Genoa.</p>

<p>It was impossible that these great movements of Venice should be unknown
at Padua. Petrarch, ever zealous for the common good of Italy, saw with
pain the kindling of a war which could not but be fatal to her, and
thought it his duty to open his heart to the Doge of Venice, who had
shown him so much friendship. He addressed to him, therefore, the
following letter from Padua, on the 14th of March, 1351:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My love for my country forces me to break silence; the goodness of your
character encourages me. Can I hold my peace whilst I hear the symptoms
of a coming storm that menaces my beloved country? Two puissant people
are flying to arms; two flourishing cities are agitated by the approach
of war. These cities are placed by nature like the two eyes of Italy;
the one in the south and west, and the other in the east and north, to
dominate over the two seas that surround them; so that, even after the
destruction of the Roman empire, this beautiful country was still
regarded as the queen of the world. I know that proud nations denied her
the empire of the land, but who dared ever to dispute with her the
empire of the sea?</p>

<p>"I shudder to think of our prospects. If Venice and Genoa turn their
victorious arms against each other, it is all over with us; we lose our
glory and the command of the sea. In this calamity we shall have a
consolation which we have ever had, namely, that if our enemies rejoice
in our calamities, they cannot at least derive any glory from them.</p>

<p>"In great affairs I have always dreaded the counsels of the young.
Youthful ignorance and inexperience have been the ruin of many empires.
I, therefore, learn with pleasure that you have named a council of
elders, to whom you have confided this affair. I expected no less than
this from your wisdom, which is far beyond your years.</p>

<p>"The state of your republic distresses me. I know the difference that
there is between the tumult of arms and the tranquillity of Parnassus. I
know that the sounds of Apollo's lyre accord but ill with the trumpets
of Mars; but if you have abandoned Parnassus, it has been only to fulfil
the duties of a good citizen and of a vigilant chief. I am persuaded, at
the same time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span> that in the midst of arms you think of peace; that you
would regard it as a triumph for yourself, and the greatest blessing you
could procure for your country. Did not Hannibal himself say that a sure
peace was more valuable than a hoped-for victory! If truth has extorted
this confession from the most warlike man that ever lived, is it not
plain that a pacific man ought to prefer peace even to a certain
victory? Who does not know that peace is the greatest of blessings, and
that war is the source of all evils?</p>

<p>"Do not deceive yourself; you have to deal with a keen people who know
not what it is to be conquered. Would it not be better to transfer the
war to Damascus, to Susa, or to Memphis? Think besides, that those whom
you are going to attack are your brothers. At Thebes, of old, two
brothers fought to their mutual destruction. Must Italy renew, in our
days, so atrocious a spectacle?</p>

<p>"Let us examine what may be the results of this war. Whether you are
conqueror or are conquered, one of the eyes of Italy will necessarily be
blinded, and the other much weakened; for it would be folly to flatter
yourself with the hopes of conquering so strong an enemy without much
effusion of blood.</p>

<p>"Brave men, powerful people! (I speak here to both of you) what is your
object&mdash;to what do you aspire? What will be the end of your dissensions?
It is not the blood of the Carthaginians or the Numantians that you are
about to spill, but it is Italian blood; the blood of a people who would
be the first to start up and offer to expend their blood, if any
barbarous nation were to attempt a new irruption among us. In that
event, their bodies would be the bucklers and ramparts of our common
country; they would live, or they would die with us. Ought the pleasure
of avenging a slight offence to carry more weight with you than the
public good and your own safety? Let revenge be the delight of women. Is
it not more glorious for men to forget an injury than to avenge it? to
pardon an enemy than to destroy him?</p>

<p>"If my feeble voice could make itself heard among those grave men who
compose your council, I am persuaded that you would not only <i>not</i>
reject the peace which is offered to you, but go to meet and embrace it
closely, so that it might not escape you. Consult your wise old men who
love the republic; they will speak the same language to you that I do.</p>

<p>"You, my lord, who are at the head of the council, and who govern your
republic, ought to recollect that the glory or the shame of these events
will fall principally on you. Raise yourself above yourself; look into,
examine everything with attention. Compare the success of the war with
the evils which it brings in its train. Weigh in a balance the good
effects and the evil, and you will say with Hannibal, that an hour is
sufficient to destroy the work of many years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>"The renown of your country is more ancient than is generally believed.
Several ages before the city of Venice was built, I find not only the
name of the Venetians famous, but also that of one of their dukes. Would
you submit to the caprices of fortune a glory acquired for so long a
time, and at so great a cost? You will render a great service to your
republic, if, preferring her safety to her glory, you give her incensed
and insane populace prudent and useful counsels, instead of offering
them brilliant and specious projects. The wise say that we cannot
purchase a virtue more precious than what is bought at the expense of
glory. If you adopt this axiom, your character will be handed down to
posterity, like that of the Duke of the Venetians, to whom I have
alluded. All the world will admire and love you.</p>

<p>"To conceal nothing from you, I confess that I have heard with grief of
your league with the King of Arragon. What! shall Italians go and
implore succour of barbarous kings to destroy Italians? You will say,
perhaps, that your enemies have set you the example. My answer is, that
they are equally culpable. According to report, Venice, in order to
satiate her rage, calls to her aid tyrants of the west; whilst Genoa
brings in those of the east. This is the source of our calamities.
Carried away by the admiration of strange things, despising, I know not
why, the good things which we find in our own climate, we sacrifice
sound Italian faith to barbarian perfidy. Madmen that we are, we seek
among venal souls that which we could find among our own brethren.</p>

<p>"Nature has given us for barriers the Alps and the two seas. Avarice,
envy, and pride, have opened these natural defences to the Cimbri, the
Huns, the Goths, the Gauls, and the Spaniards. How often have we recited
the words of Virgil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Impius h&aelig;c tam culta novalia miles habebit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbarus has segetes.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Athens and Lacedemon had between them a species of rivalship similar to
yours: but their forces were not by any means so nearly balanced.
Lacedemon had an advantage over Athens, which put it in the power of the
former to destroy her rival, if she had wished it; but she replied, 'God
forbid that I should pull out one of the eyes of Greece!' If this
beautiful sentiment came from a people whom Plato reproaches with their
avidity for conquest and dominion, what still softer reply ought we not
to expect from the most modest of nations!</p>

<p>"Amidst the movements which agitate you, it is impossible for me to be
tranquil. When I see one party cutting down trees to construct vessels,
and others sharpening their swords and darts, I should think myself
guilty if I did not seize my pen, which is my only weapon, to counsel
peace. I am aware with what circumspection we ought to speak to our
superiors; but the love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span> our country has no superior. If it should
carry me beyond bounds, it will serve as my excuse before you, and
oblige you to pardon me.</p>

<p>"Throwing myself at the feet of the chiefs of two nations who are going
to war, I say to them, with tears in my eyes, 'Throw away your arms;
give one another the embrace of peace! unite your hearts and your
colours. By this means the ocean and the Euxine shall be open to you.
Your ships will arrive in safety at Taprobane, at the Fortunate Isles,
at Thule, and even at the poles. The kings and their people will meet
you with respect; the Indian, the Englishman, the &AElig;thiopian, will dread
you. May peace reign among you, and may you have nothing to fear!'
Adieu! greatest of dukes, and best of men!"</p>

<p>This letter produced no effect. Andrea Dandolo, in his answer to it,
alleges the thousand and one affronts and outrages which Venice had
suffered from Genoa. At the same time he pays a high compliment to the
eloquence of Petrarch's epistle, and says that it is a production which
could emanate only from a mind inspired by the divine Spirit.</p>

<p>During the spring of this year, 1351, Petrarch put his last finish to a
canzone, on the subject still nearest to his heart, the death of his
Laura, and to a sonnet on the same subject. In April, his attention was
recalled from visionary things by the arrival of Boccaccio, who was sent
by the republic of Florence to announce to him the recall of his family
to their native land, and the restoration of his family fortune, as well
as to invite him to the home of his ancestors, in the name of the
Florentine republic. The invitation was conveyed in a long and
flattering letter; but it appeared, from the very contents of this
epistle, that the Florentines wished our poet's acceptance of their
offer to be as advantageous to themselves as to him. They were
establishing a University, and they wished to put Petrarch at the head
of it. Petrarch replied in a letter apparently full of gratitude and
satisfaction, but in which he by no means pledged himself to be the
gymnasiarch of their new college; and, agreeably to his original
intention, he set out from Padua on the 3rd of May, 1351, for Provence.</p>

<p>Petrarch took the road to Vicenza, where he arrived at sunset. He
hesitated whether he should stop there, or take advantage of the
remainder of the day and go farther. But, meeting with some interesting
persons whose conversation beguiled him, night came on before he was
aware how late it was. Their conversation, in the course of the evening,
ran upon Cicero. Many were the eulogies passed on the great old Roman;
but Petrarch, after having lauded his divine genius and eloquence, said
something about his inconsistency. Every one was astonished at our
poet's boldness, but particularly a man, venerable for his age and
knowledge, who was an idolater of Cicero. Petrarch argued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span> pretty freely
against the political character of the ancient orator. The same opinion
as to Cicero's weakness seems rather to have gained ground in later
ages. At least, it is now agreed that Cicero's political life will not
bear throughout an uncharitable investigation, though the political
difficulties of his time demand abundant allowance.</p>

<p>Petrarch departed next morning for Verona, where he reckoned on
remaining only for a few days; but it was impossible for him to resist
the importunities of Azzo Correggio, Guglielmo di Pastrengo, and his
other friends. By them he was detained during the remainder of the
month. "The requests of a friend," he said, on this occasion, "are
always chains upon me."</p>

<p>Petrarch arrived, for the sixth time, at Vaucluse on the 27th of June,
1351. He first announced himself to Philip of Cabassoles, Bishop of
Cavaillon, to whom he had already sent, during his journey, some Latin
verses, in which he speaks of Vaucluse as the most charming place in the
universe. "When a child," he says, "I visited it, and it nourished my
youth in its sunny bosom. When grown to manhood, I passed some of the
pleasantest years of my life in the shut-up valley. Grown old, I wish to
pass in it my last years."</p>

<p>The sight of his romantic hermitage, of the capacious grotto which had
listened to his sighs for Laura, of his garden, and of his library, was,
undoubtedly, sweet to Petrarch; and, though he had promised Boccaccio to
come back to Italy, he had not the fortitude to determine on a sudden
return. He writes to one of his Italian friends, "When I left my native
country, I promised to return to it in the autumn; but time, place, and
circumstances, often oblige us to change our resolutions. As far as I
can judge, it will be necessary for me to remain here for two years. My
friends in Italy, I trust, will pardon me if I do not keep my promise to
them. The inconstancy of the human mind must serve as my excuse. I have
now experienced that change of place is the only thing which can long
keep from us the <i>ennui</i> that is inseparable from a sedentary life."</p>

<p>At the same time, whilst Vaucluse threw recollections tender, though
melancholy, over Petrarch's mind, it does not appear that Avignon had
assumed any new charm in his absence: on the contrary, he found it
plunged more than ever in luxury, wantonness, and gluttony. Clement VI.
had replenished the church, at the request of the French king, with
numbers of cardinals, many of whom were so young and licentious, that
the most scandalous abominations prevailed amongst them. "At this time,"
says Matthew Villani, "no regard was paid either to learning or virtue;
and a man needed not to blush for anything, if he could cover his head
with a red hat. Pietro Ruggiero, one of those exemplary new cardinals,
was only eighteen years of age." Petrarch vented his indignation on this
occasion in his seventh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span> eclogue, which is a satire upon the Pontiff and
his cardinals, the interlocutors being Micione, or Clement himself, and
Epi, or the city of Avignon. The poem, if it can be so called, is
clouded with allegory, and denaturalized with pastoral conceits; yet it
is worth being explored by any one anxious to trace the first fountains
of reform among Catholics, as a proof of church abuses having been
exposed, two centuries before the Reformation, by a Catholic and a
churchman.</p>

<p>At this crisis, the Court of Avignon, which, in fact, had not known very
well what to do about the affairs of Rome, were now anxious to inquire
what sort of government would be the most advisable, after the fall of
Rienzo. Since that event, the Cardinal Legate had re-established the
ancient government, having created two senators, the one from the house
of Colonna, the other from that of the Orsini. But, very soon, those
houses were divided by discord, and the city was plunged into all the
evils which it had suffered before the existence of the Tribuneship.
"The community at large," says Matthew Villani, "returned to such
condition, that strangers and travellers found themselves like sheep
among wolves." Clement VI. was weary of seeing the metropolis of
Christianity a prey to anarchy. He therefore chose four cardinals, whose
united deliberations might appease these troubles, and he imagined that
he could establish in Rome a form of government that should be durable.
The cardinals requested Petrarch to give his opinion on this important
affair. Petrarch wrote to them a most eloquent epistle, full of
enthusiastic ideas of the grandeur of Rome. It is not exactly known what
effect he produced by his writing on this subject; but on that account
we are not to conclude that he wrote in vain.</p>

<p>Petrarch had brought to Avignon his son John, who was still very young.
He had obtained for him a canonicate at Verona. Thither he immediately
despatched him, with letters to Guglielmo di Pastrengo and Rinaldo di
Villa Franca, charging the former of these friends to superintend his
son's general character and manners, and the other to cultivate his
understanding. Petrarch, in his letter to Rinaldo, gives a description
of John, which is neither very flattering to the youth, nor calculated
to give us a favourable opinion of his father's mode of managing his
education. By his own account, it appears that he had never brought the
boy to confide in him. This was a capital fault, for the young are
naturally ingenuous; so that the acquisition of their confidence is the
very first step towards their docility; and, for maintaining parental
authority, there is no need to overawe them. "As far as I can judge of
my son," says Petrarch, "he has a tolerable understanding; but I am not
certain of this, for I do not sufficiently know him. When he is with me
he always keeps silence; whether my presence is irksome and confusing to
him, or whether shame for his ignorance closes his lips. I suspect it is
the latter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span> for I perceive too clearly his antipathy to letters. I
never saw it stronger in any one; he dreads and detests nothing so much
as a book; yet he was brought up at Parma, Verona, and Padua. I
sometimes direct a few sharp pleasantries at this disposition. 'Take
care,' I say, 'lest you should eclipse your neighbour, Virgil.' When I
talk in this manner, he looks down and blushes. On this behaviour alone
I build my hope. He is modest, and has a docility which renders him
susceptible of every impression." This is a melancholy confession, on
the part of Petrarch, of his own incompetence to make the most of his
son's mind, and a confession the more convincing that it is made
unconsciously.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1352, the people of Avignon witnessed the impressive
spectacle of the far-famed Tribune Rienzo entering their city, but in a
style very different from the pomp of his late processions in Rome. He
had now for his attendants only two archers, between whom he walked as a
prisoner. It is necessary to say a few words about the circumstances
which befell Rienzo after his fall, and which brought him now to the
Pope's tribunal at Avignon.</p>

<p>Petrarch says of him at this period, "The Tribune, formerly so powerful
and dreaded, but now the most unhappy of men, has been brought hither as
a prisoner. I praised and I adored him. I loved his virtue, and I
admired his courage. I thought that Rome was about to resume, under him,
the empire she formerly held. Ah! had he continued as he began, he would
have been praised and admired by the world and by posterity. On entering
the city," Petrarch continues, "he inquired if I was there. I knew not
whether he hoped for succour from me, or what I could do to serve him.
In the process against him they accuse him of nothing criminal. They
cannot impute to him having joined with bad men. All that they charge
him with is an attempt to give freedom to the republic, and to make Rome
the centre of its government. And is this a crime worthy of the wheel or
the gibbet? A Roman citizen afflicted to see his country, which is by
right the mistress of the world, the slave of the vilest of men!"</p>

<p>Clement was glad to have Rienzo in his power, and ordered him into his
presence. Thither the Tribune came, not in the least disconcerted. He
denied the accusation of heresy, and insisted that his cause should be
re-examined with more equity. The Pope made him no reply, but imprisoned
him in a high tower, in which he was chained by the leg to the floor of
his apartment. In other respects he was treated mildly, allowed books to
read, and supplied with dishes from the Pope's kitchen.</p>

<p>Rienzo begged to be allowed an advocate to defend him; his request was
refused. This refusal enraged Petrarch, who wrote, according to De Sade
and others, on this occasion, that mysterious letter, which is found in
his "Epistles without a title." It is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</a></span> appeal to the Romans in behalf
of their Tribune. I must confess that even the authority of De Sade does
not entirely eradicate from my mind a suspicion as to the spuriousness
of this inflammatory letter, from the consequences of which Petrarch
could hardly have escaped with impunity.</p>

<p>One of the circumstances that detained Petrarch at Avignon was the
illness of the Pope, which retarded his decision on several important
affairs. Clement VI. was fast approaching to his end, and Petrarch had
little hope of his convalescence, at least in the hands of doctors. A
message from the Pope produced an imprudent letter from the poet, in
which he says, "Holy father! I shudder at the account of your fever;
but, believe me, I am not a flatterer. I tremble to see your bed always
surrounded with physicians, who are never agreed, because it would be a
reproach to the second to think like the first. 'It is not to be
doubted,' as Pliny says, 'that physicians, desiring to raise a name by
their discoveries, make experiments upon us, and thus barter away our
lives. There is no law for punishing their extreme ignorance. They learn
their trade at our expense, they make some progress in the art of
curing; and they alone are permitted to murder with impunity.' Holy
father! consider as your enemies the crowd of physicians who beset you.
It is in our age that we behold verified the prediction of the elder
Cato, who declared that corruption would be general when the Greeks
should have transmitted the sciences to Rome, and, above all, the
science of healing. Whole nations have done without this art. The Roman
republic, according to Pliny, was without physicians for six hundred
years, and was never in a more flourishing condition."</p>

<p>The Pope, a poor dying old man, communicated Petrarch's letter
immediately to his physicians, and it kindled in the whole faculty a
flame of indignation, worthy of being described by Moli&egrave;re. Petrarch
made a general enemy of the physicians, though, of course, the weakest
and the worst of them were the first to attack him. One of them told
him, "You are a foolhardy man, who, contemning the physicians, have no
fear either of the fever or of the malaria." Petrarch replied, "I
certainly have no assurance of being free from the attacks of either;
but, if I were attacked by either, I should not think of calling in
physicians."</p>

<p>His first assailant was one of Clement's own physicians, who loaded him
with scurrility in a formal letter. These circumstances brought forth
our poet's "Four Books of Invectives against Physicians," a work in
which he undoubtedly exposes a great deal of contemporary quackery, but
which, at the same time, scarcely leaves the physician-hunter on higher
ground than his antagonists.</p>

<p>In the last year of his life, Clement VI. wished to attach our poet
permanently to his court by making him his secretary, and Petrarch,
after much coy refusal, was at last induced, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</a></span> solicitations of
his friends, to accept the office. But before he could enter upon it, an
objection to his filling it was unexpectedly started. It was discovered
that his style was too lofty to suit the humility of the Roman Church.
The elevation of Petrarch's style might be obvious, but certainly the
humility of the Church was a bright discovery. Petrarch, according to
his own account, so far from promising to bring down his magniloquence
to a level with church humility, seized the objection as an excuse for
declining the secretaryship. He compares his joy on this occasion to
that of a prisoner finding the gates of his prison thrown open. He
returned to Vaucluse, where he waited impatiently for the autumn, when
he meant to return to Italy. He thus describes, in a letter to his dear
Simonides, the manner of life which he there led:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I make war upon my body, which I regard as my enemy. My eyes, that have
made me commit so many follies, are well fixed on a safe object. They
look only on a woman who is withered, dark, and sunburnt. Her soul,
however, is as white as her complexion is black, and she has the air of
being so little conscious of her own appearance, that her homeliness may
be said to become her. She passes whole days in the open fields, when
the grasshoppers can scarcely endure the sun. Her tanned hide braves the
heats of the dog-star, and, in the evening, she arrives as fresh as if
she had just risen from bed. She does all the work of my house, besides
taking care of her husband and children and attending my guests. She
seems occupied with everybody but herself. At night she sleeps on
vine-branches; she eats only black bread and roots, and drinks water and
vinegar. If you were to give her anything more delicate, she would be
the worse for it: such is the force of habit.</p>

<p>"Though I have still two fine suits of clothes, I never wear them. If
you saw me, you would take me for a labourer or a shepherd, though I was
once so tasteful in my dress. The times are changed; the eyes which I
wished to please are now shut; and, perhaps, even if they were opened,
they would not <i>now</i> have the same empire over me."</p>

<p>In another letter from Vaucluse, he says: "I rise at midnight; I go out
at break of day; I study in the fields as in my library; I read, I
write, I dream; I struggle against indolence, luxury, and pleasure. I
wander all day among the arid mountains, the fresh valleys, and the deep
caverns. I walk much on the banks of the Sorgue, where I meet no one to
distract me. I recall the past. I deliberate on the future; and, in this
contemplation, I find a resource against my solitude." In the same
letter he avows that he could accustom himself to any habitation in the
world, except Avignon. At this time he was meditating to recross the
Alps.</p>

<p>Early in September, 1352, the Cardinal of Boulogne departed for Paris,
in order to negotiate a peace between the Kings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span> France and England.
Petrarch went to take his leave of him, and asked if he had any orders
for Italy, for which he expected soon to set out. The Cardinal told him
that he should be only a month upon his journey, and that he hoped to
see him at Avignon on his return. He had, in fact, kind views with
regard to Petrarch. He wished to procure for him some good establishment
in France, and wrote to him upon his route, "Pray do not depart yet.
Wait until I return, or, at least, until I write to you on an important
affair that concerns yourself." This letter, which, by the way, evinces
that our poet's circumstances were not independent of church promotion,
changed the plans of Petrarch, who remained at Avignon nearly the whole
of the months of September and October.</p>

<p>During this delay, he heard constant reports of the war that was going
on between the Genoese and the Venetians. In the spring of the year
1352, their fleets met in the Propontis, and had a conflict almost
unexampled, which lasted during two days and a tempestuous night. The
Genoese, upon the whole, had the advantage, and, in revenge for the
Greeks having aided the Venetians, they made a league with the Turks.
The Pope, who had it earnestly at heart to put a stop to this fatal war,
engaged the belligerents to send their ambassadors to Avignon, and there
to treat for peace. The ambassadors came; but a whole month was spent in
negotiations which ended in nothing. Petrarch in vain employed his
eloquence, and the Pope his conciliating talents. In these
circumstances, Petrarch wrote a letter to the Genoese government, which
does infinite credit to his head and his heart. He used every argument
that common sense or humanity could suggest to show the folly of the
war, but his arguments were thrown away on spirits too fierce for
reasoning.</p>

<p>A few days after writing this letter, as the Cardinal of Boulogne had
not kept his word about returning to Avignon, and as he heard no news of
him, Petrarch determined to set out for Italy. He accordingly started on
the 16th of November, 1352; but scarcely had he left his own house, with
all his papers, when he was overtaken by heavy falls of rain. At first
he thought of going back immediately; but he changed his purpose, and
proceeded as far as Cavaillon, which is two leagues from Vaucluse, in
order to take leave of his friend, the Bishop of Cabassole. His good
friend was very unwell, but received him with joy, and pressed him to
pass the night under his roof. That night and all the next day it rained
so heavily that Petrarch, more from fear of his books and papers being
damaged than from anxiety about his own health, gave up his Italian
journey for the present, and, returning to Vaucluse, spent there the
rest of November and the whole of December, 1352.</p>

<p>Early in December, Petrarch heard of the death of Clement VI., and this
event gave him occasion for more epistles, both against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[Pg xc]</a></span> the Roman court
and his enemies, the physicians. Clement's death was ascribed to
different causes. Petrarch, of course, imputed it to his doctors.
Villani's opinion is the most probable, that he died of a protracted
fever. He was buried with great pomp in the church of N&ocirc;tre Dame at
Avignon; but his remains, after some time, were removed to the abbey of
Chaise Dieu, in Auvergne, where his tomb was violated by the Huguenots
in 1562. Scandal says that they made a football of his head, and that
the Marquis de Courton afterwards converted his skull into a
drinking-cup.</p>

<p>It need not surprise us that his Holiness never stood high in the good
graces of Petrarch. He was a Limousin, who never loved Italy go much as
Gascony, and, in place of re-establishing the holy seat at Rome, he
completed the building of the papal palace at Avignon, which his
predecessor had begun. These were faults that eclipsed all the good
qualities of Clement VI. in the eyes of Petrarch, and, in the sixth of
his eclogues, the poet has drawn the character of Clement in odious
colours, and, with equal freedom, has described most of the cardinals of
his court. Whether there was perfect consistency between this hatred to
the Pope and his thinking, as he certainly did for a time, of becoming
his secretary, may admit of a doubt. I am not, however, disposed to deny
some allowance to Petrarch for his dislike of Clement, who was a
voluptuary in private life, and a corrupted ruler of the Church.</p>

<p>Early in May, 1353, Petrarch departed for Italy, and we find him very
soon afterwards at the palace of John Visconti of Milan, whom he used to
call the greatest man in Italy. This prince, uniting the sacerdotal with
the civil power, reigned absolute in Milan. He was master of Lombardy,
and made all Italy tremble at his hostility. Yet, in spite of his
despotism, John Visconti was a lover of letters, and fond of having
literary men at his court. He exercised a cunning influence over our
poet, and detained him. Petrarch, knowing that Milan was a troubled city
and a stormy court, told the Prince that, being a priest, his vocation
did not permit him to live in a princely court, and in the midst of
arms. "For that matter," replied the Archbishop, "I am myself an
ecclesiastic; I wish to press no employment upon you, but only to
request you to remain as an ornament of my court." Petrarch, taken by
surprise, had not fortitude to resist his importunities. All that he
bargained for was, that he should have a habitation sufficiently distant
from the city, and that he should not be obliged to make any change in
his ordinary mode of living. The Archbishop was too happy to possess him
on these terms.</p>

<p>Petrarch, accordingly, took up his habitation in the western part of the
city, near the Vercellina gate, and the church of St. Ambrosio. His
house was flanked with two towers, stood behind the city wall, and
looked out upon a rich and beautiful country, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</a></span> far as the Alps, the
tops of which, although it was summer, were still covered with snow.
Great was the joy of Petrarch when he found himself in a house near the
church of that Saint Ambrosio, for whom he had always cherished a
peculiar reverence. He himself tells us that he never entered that
temple without experiencing rekindled devotion. He visited the statue of
the saint, which was niched in one of the walls, and the stone figure
seemed to him to breathe, such was the majesty and tranquillity of the
sculpture. Near the church arose the chapel, where St. Augustin, after
his victory over his refractory passions, was bathed in the sacred
fountain of St. Ambrosio, and absolved from penance for his past life.</p>

<p>All this time, whilst Petrarch was so well pleased with his new abode,
his friends were astonished, and even grieved, at his fixing himself at
Milan. At Avignon, Socrates, Guido Settimo, and the Bishop of Cavaillon,
said among themselves, "What! this proud republican, who breathed
nothing but independence, who scorned an office in the papal court as a
gilded yoke, has gone and thrown himself into the chains of the tyrant
of Italy; this misanthrope, who delighted only in the silence of fields,
and perpetually praised a secluded life, now inhabits the most bustling
of cities!" At Florence, his friends entertained the same sentiments,
and wrote to him reproachfully on the subject. "I would wish to be
silent," says Boccaccio, "but I cannot hold my peace. My reverence for
you would incline me to hold silence, but my indignation obliges me to
speak out. How has Silvanus acted?" (Under the name of Silvanus he
couches that of Petrarch, in allusion to his love of rural retirement.)
"He has forgotten his dignity; he has forgotten all the language he used
to hold respecting the state of Italy, his hatred of the Archbishop, and
his love of liberty; and he would imprison the Muses in that court. To
whom can we now give our faith, when Silvanus, who formerly pronounced
the Visconti a cruel tyrant, has now bowed himself to the yoke which he
once so boldly condemned? How has the Visconti obtained this truckling,
which neither King Robert, nor the Pope, nor the Emperor, could ever
obtain? You will say, perhaps, that you have been ill-used by your
fellow-citizens, who have withheld from you your paternal property. I
disapprove not your just indignation; but Heaven forbid I should believe
that, righteously and honestly, any injury, from whomsoever we may
receive it, can justify our taking part against our country. It is in
vain for you to allege that you have not incited him to war against our
country, nor lent him either your arm or advice. How can you be happy
with him, whilst you are hearing of the ruins, the conflagrations, the
imprisonments, the deaths, and the rapines, that he spreads around him?"</p>

<p>Petrarch's answers to these and other reproaches which his friends sent
to him were cold, vague, and unsatisfactory. He denied that he had
sacrificed his liberty; and told Boccaccio that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[Pg xcii]</a></span> after all, it was less
humiliating to be subservient to a single tyrant than to be, as he,
Boccaccio, was, subservient to a whole tyrannical people. This was an
unwise, implied confession on the part of Petrarch that he was the slave
of Visconti. Sismondi may be rather harsh in pronouncing Petrarch to
have been all his life a Troubadour; but there is something in his
friendship with the Lord of Milan that palliates the accusation. In
spite of this severe letter from Boccaccio, it is strange, and yet,
methinks, honourable to both, that their friendship was never broken.</p>

<p>Levati, in his "<i>Viaggi di Petrarca</i>," ascribes the poet's settlement at
Milan to his desire of accumulating a little money, not for himself, but
for his natural children; and in some of Petrarch's letters, subsequent
to this period, there are allusions to his own circumstances which give
countenance to this suspicion.</p>

<p>However this may be, Petrarch deceived himself if he expected to have
long tranquillity in such a court as that of Milan. He was perpetually
obliged to visit the Viscontis, and to be present at every feast that
they gave to honour the arrival of any illustrious stranger. A more than
usually important visitant soon came to Milan, in the person of Cardinal
Egidio Albornoz, who arrived at the head of an army, with a view to
restore to the Church large portions of its territory which had been
seized by some powerful families. The Cardinal entered Milan on the 14th
of September, 1353. John Visconti, though far from being delighted at
his arrival, gave him an honourable reception, defrayed all the expenses
of his numerous retinue, and treated him magnificently. He went out
himself to meet him, two miles from the city, accompanied by his nephews
and his courtiers, including Petrarch. Our poet joined the suite of
Galeazzo Visconti, and rode near him. The Legate and his retinue rode
also on horseback. When the two parties met, the dust, that rose in
clouds from the feet of the horses, prevented them from discerning each
other. Petrarch, who had advanced beyond the rest, found himself, he
knew not how, in the midst of the Legate's train, and very near to him.
Salutations passed on either side, but with very little speaking, for
the dust had dried their throats.</p>

<p>Petrarch made a backward movement, to regain his place among his
company. His horse, in backing, slipped with his hind-legs into a ditch
on the side of the road, but, by a sort of miracle, the animal kept his
fore-feet for some time on the top of the ditch. If he had fallen back,
he must have crushed his rider. Petrarch was not afraid, for he was not
aware of his danger; but Galeazzo Visconti and his people dismounted to
rescue the poet, who escaped without injury.</p>

<p>The Legate treated Petrarch, who little expected it, with the utmost
kindness and distinction, and, granting all that he asked for his
friends, pressed him to mention something worthy of his own acceptance.
Petrarch replied: "When I ask for my friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span> is it not the same as for
myself? Have I not the highest satisfaction in receiving favours for
them? I have long put a rein on my own desires. Of what, then, can I
stand in need?"</p>

<p>After the departure of the Legate, Petrarch retired to his <i>rus in
urbe</i>. In a letter dated thence to his friend the Prior of the Holy
Apostles, we find him acknowledging feelings that were far distant from
settled contentment. "You have heard," he says, "how much my peace has
been disturbed, and my leisure broken in upon, by an importunate crowd
and by unforeseen occupations. The Legate has left Milan. He was
received at Florence with unbounded applause: as for poor me, I am again
in my retreat. I have been long free, happy, and master of my time; but
I feel, at present, that liberty and leisure are only for souls of
consummate virtue. When we are not of that class of beings, nothing is
more dangerous for a heart subject to the passions than to be free,
idle, and alone. The snares of voluptuousness are <i>then</i> more dangerous,
and corrupt thoughts gain an easier entrance&mdash;above all, love, that
seducing tormentor, from whom I thought that I had now nothing more to
fear."</p>

<p>From these expressions we might almost conclude that he had again fallen
in love; but if it was so, we have no evidence as to the object of his
new passion.</p>

<p>During his half-retirement, Petrarch learned news which disturbed his
repose. A courier arrived, one night, bringing an account of the entire
destruction of the Genoese fleet, in a naval combat with that of the
Venetians, which took place on the 19th of August, 1353, near the island
of Sardinia. The letters which the poet had written, in order to
conciliate those two republics, had proved as useless as the
pacificatory efforts of Clement VI. and his successor, Innocent.
Petrarch, who had constantly predicted the eventual success of Genoa,
could hardly believe his senses, when he heard of the Genoese being
defeated at sea. He wrote a letter of lamentation and astonishment on
the subject to his friend Guido Settimo. He saw, as it were, one of the
eyes of his country destroying the other. The courier, who brought these
tidings to Milan, gave a distressing account of the state of Genoa.
There was not a family which had not lost one of its members.</p>

<p>Petrarch passed a whole night in composing a letter to the Genoese, in
which he exhorted them, after the example of the Romans, never to
despair of the republic. His lecture never reached them. On awakening in
the morning, Petrarch learned that the Genoese had lost every spark of
their courage, and that the day before they had subscribed the most
humiliating concessions in despair.</p>

<p>It has been alleged by some of his biographers that Petrarch suppressed
his letter to the Genoese from his fear of the Visconti family. John
Visconti had views on Genoa, which was a port so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</a></span> conveniently situated
that he naturally coveted the possession of it. He invested it on all
sides by land, whilst its other enemies blockaded it by sea; so that the
city was reduced to famine. The partizans of John Visconti insinuated to
the Genoese that they had no other remedy than to place themselves under
the protection of the Prince of Milan. Petrarch was not ignorant of the
Visconti's views; and it has been, therefore, suspected that he kept
back his exhortatory epistle from his apprehension, that if he had
despatched it, John Visconti would have made it the last epistle of his
life. The morning after writing it, he found that Genoa had signed a
treaty of almost abject submission; after which his exhortation would
have been only an insult to the vanquished.</p>

<p>The Genoese were not long in deliberating on the measures which they
were to take. In a few days their deputies arrived at Milan, imploring
the aid and protection of John Visconti, as well as offering him the
republic of Genoa and all that belonged to it. After some conferences,
the articles of the treaty were signed; and the Lord of Milan accepted
with pleasure the possession that was offered to him.</p>

<p>Petrarch, as a counsellor of Milan, attended these conferences, and
condoled with the deputies from Genoa; though we cannot suppose that he
approved, in his heart, of the desperate submission of the Genoese in
thus throwing themselves into the arms of the tyrant of Italy, who had
been so long anxious either to invade them in open quarrel, or to enter
their States upon a more amicable pretext. John Visconti immediately
took possession of the city of Genoa; and, after having deposed the doge
and senate, took into his own hands the reins of government.</p>

<p>Weary of Milan, Petrarch betook himself to the country, and made a
temporary residence at the castle of St. Columba, which was now a
monastery. This mansion was built in 1164, by the celebrated Frederick
Barbarossa. It now belonged to the Carthusian monks of Pavia. Petrarch
has given a beautiful description of this edifice, and of the
magnificent view which it commands.</p>

<p>Whilst he was enjoying this glorious scenery, he received a letter from
Socrates, informing him that he had gone to Vaucluse in company with
Guido Settimo, whose intention to accompany Petrarch in his journey to
Italy had been prevented by a fit of illness. Petrarch, when he heard of
this visit, wrote to express his happiness at their thus honouring his
habitation, at the same time lamenting that he was not one of their
party. "Repair," he said, "often to the same retreat. Make use of my
books, which deplore the absence of their owner, and the death of their
keeper" (he alluded to his old servant). "My country-house is the temple
of peace, and the home of repose."</p>

<p>From the contents of his letter, on this occasion, it is obvious that he
had not yet found any spot in Italy where he could de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span>termine on fixing
himself permanently; otherwise he would not have left his books behind
him.</p>

<p>When he wrote about his books, he was little aware of the danger that
was impending over them. On Christmas day a troop of robbers, who had
for some time infested the neighbourhood of Vaucluse, set fire to the
poet's house, after having taken away everything that they could carry
off. An ancient vault stopped the conflagration, and saved the mansion
from being entirely consumed by the flames. Luckily, the person to whose
care he had left his house&mdash;the son of the worthy rustic, lately
deceased&mdash;having a presentiment of the robbery, had conveyed to the
castle a great many books which Petrarch left behind him; and the
robbers, believing that there were persons in the castle to defend it,
had not the courage to make an attack.</p>

<p>As Petrarch grew old, we do not find him improve in consistency. In his
letter, dated the 21st of October, 1353, it is evident that he had a
return of his hankering after Vaucluse. He accordingly wrote to his
friends, requesting that they would procure him an establishment in the
Comtat. Socrates, upon this, immediately communicated with the Bishop of
Cavaillon, who did all that he could to obtain for the poet the object
of his wish. It appears that the Bishop endeavoured to get for him a
good benefice in his own diocese. The thing was never accomplished.
Without doubt, the enemies, whom he had excited by writing freely about
the Church, and who were very numerous at Avignon, frustrated his
wishes.</p>

<p>After some time Petrarch received a letter from the Emperor Charles IV.
in answer to one which the poet had expedited to him about three years
before. Our poet, of course, did not fail to acknowledge his Imperial
Majesty's late-coming letter. He commences his reply with a piece of
pleasantry: "I see very well," he says, "that it is as difficult for
your Imperial Majesty's despatches and couriers to cross the Alps, as it
is for your person and legions." He wonders that the Emperor had not
followed his advice, and hastened into Italy, to take possession of the
empire. "What consoles me," he adds, "is, that if you do not adopt my
sentiments, you at least approve of my zeal; and that is the greatest
recompense I could receive." He argues the question with the Emperor
with great force and eloquence; and, to be sure, there never was a
fairer opportunity for Charles IV. to enter Italy. The reasons which his
Imperial Majesty alleges, for waiting a little time to watch the course
of events, display a timid and wavering mind.</p>

<p>A curious part of his letter is that in which he mentions Rienzo.
"Lately," he says, "we have seen at Rome, suddenly elevated to supreme
power, a man who was neither king, nor consul, nor patrician, and who
was hardly known as a Roman citizen. Although he was not distinguished
by his ancestry, yet he dared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</a></span> to declare himself the restorer of public
liberty. What title more brilliant for an obscure man! Tuscany
immediately submitted to him. All Italy followed her example; and Europe
and the whole world were in one movement. We have seen the event; it is
not a doubtful tale of history. Already, under the reign of the Tribune,
justice, peace, good faith, and security, were restored, and we saw
vestiges of the golden age appearing once more. In the moment of his
most brilliant success, he chose to submit to others. I blame nobody. I
wish neither to acquit nor to condemn; but I know what I ought to think.
That man had only the title of Tribune. Now, if the name of Tribune
could produce such an effect, what might not the title of C&aelig;sar
produce!"</p>

<p>Charles did not enter Italy until a year after the date of our poet's
epistle; and it is likely that the increasing power of John Visconti
made a far deeper impression on his irresolute mind than all the
rhetoric of Petrarch. Undoubtedly, the petty lords of Italy were fearful
of the vipers of Milan. It was thus that they denominated the Visconti
family, in allusion to their coat of arms, which represented an immense
serpent swallowing a child, though the device was not their own, but
borrowed from a standard which they had taken from the Saracens. The
submission of Genoa alarmed the whole of Italy. The Venetians took
measures to form a league against the Visconti; and the Princes of
Padua, Modena, Mantua, and Verona joined it, and the confederated lords
sent a deputation to the Emperor, to beg that he would support them; and
they proposed that he should enter Italy at their expense. The
opportunity was too good to be lost; and the Emperor promised to do all
that they wished. This league gave great trouble to John Visconti. In
order to appease the threatening storm, he immediately proposed to the
Emperor that he should come to Milan and receive the iron crown; while
he himself, by an embassy from Milan, would endeavour to restore peace
between the Venetians and the Genoese.</p>

<p>Petrarch appeared to John Visconti the person most likely to succeed in
this negotiation, by his eloquence, and by his intimacy with Andrea
Dandolo, who governed the republic of Venice. The poet now wished for
repose, and journeys began to fatigue him; but the Visconti knew so well
how to flatter and manage him, that he could not resist the proposal.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1354, before he departed for Venice,
Petrarch received a present, which gave him no small delight. It was a
Greek Homer, sent to him by Nichola Sigeros, Pr&aelig;tor of Romagna. Petrarch
wrote a long letter of thanks to Sigeros, in which there is a remarkable
confession of the small progress which he had made in the Greek
language, though at the same time he begs his friend Sigeros to send him
copies of Hesiod and Euripides.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards he set out to Venice. He was the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span> of the
embassy. He went with confidence, flattering himself that he should find
the Venetians more tractable and disposed to peace, both from their fear
of John Visconti, and from some checks which their fleet had
experienced, since their victory off Sardinia. But he was unpleasantly
astonished to find the Venetians more exasperated than humbled by their
recent losses, and by the union of the Lord of Milan with the Genoese.
All his eloquence could not bring them to accept the proposals he had to
offer. Petrarch completely failed in his negotiation, and, after passing
a month at Venice, he returned to Milan full of chagrin.</p>

<p>Two circumstances seem to have contributed to render the Venetians
intractable. The princes with whom they were leagued had taken into
their pay the mercenary troops of Count Lando, which composed a very
formidable force; and further, the Emperor promised to appear very soon
in Italy at the head of an army.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards, Petrarch wrote to the Doge of Venice, saying,
that he saw with grief that the hearts of the Venetians were shut
against wise counsels, and he then praises John Visconti as a lover of
peace and humanity.</p>

<p>After a considerable interval, Andrea Dandolo answered our poet's
letter, and was very sarcastic upon him for his eulogy on John Visconti.
At this moment, Visconti was arming the Genoese fleet, the command of
which he gave to Paganino Doria, the admiral who had beaten the
Venetians in the Propontis. Doria set sail with thirty-three vessels,
entered the Adriatic, sacked and pillaged some towns, and did much
damage on the Venetian coast. The news of this descent spread
consternation in Venice. It was believed that the Genoese fleet were in
the roads; and the Doge took all possible precautions to secure the
safety of the State.</p>

<p>But Dandolo's health gave way at this crisis, vexed as he was to see the
maiden city so humbled in her pride. His constitution rapidly declined,
and he died the 8th of September, 1354. He was extremely popular among
the Venetians. Petrarch, in a letter written shortly after his death,
says of him: "He was a virtuous man, upright, full of love and zeal for
his republic; learned, eloquent, wise, and affable. He had only one
fault, to wit, that he loved war too much. From this error he judged of
a cause by its event. The luckiest cause always appeared to him the most
just, which made him often repeat what Scipio Africanus said, and what
Lucan makes C&aelig;sar repeat: 'H&aelig;c acies victum factura nocentem.'"</p>

<p>If Dandolo had lived a little longer, and continued his ethical theory
of judging a cause by its success, he would have had a hint, from the
disasters of Venice, that his own cause was not the most righteous. The
Genoese, having surprised the Venetians off the island of Sapienza,
obtained one of the completest victories on record. All the Venetian
vessels, with the exception of one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[Pg xcviii]</a></span> escaped, were taken, together
with their admiral. It is believed that, if the victors had gone
immediately to Venice, they might have taken the city, which was
defenceless, and in a state of consternation; but the Genoese preferred
returning home to announce their triumph, and to partake in the public
joy. About the time of the Doge's death, another important public event
took place in the death of John Visconti. He had a carbuncle upon his
forehead, just above the eyebrows, which he imprudently caused to be
cut; and, on the very day of the operation, October 4th, 1354, he
expired so suddenly as not to have time to receive the sacrament.</p>

<p>John Visconti had three nephews, Matteo, Galeazzo, and Barnabo. They
were his heirs, and took possession of his dominions in common, a few
days after his death, without any dispute among themselves. The day for
their inauguration was fixed, such was the superstition of the times, by
an astrologer; and on that day Petrarch was commissioned to make to the
assembled people an address suited to the ceremony. He was still in the
midst of his harangue, when the astrologer declared with a loud voice
that the moment for the ceremony was come, and that it would be
dangerous to let it pass. Petrarch, heartily as he despised the false
science, immediately stopped his discourse. The astrologer, somewhat
disconcerted, replied that there was still a little time, and that the
orator might continue to speak. Petrarch answered that he had nothing
more to say. Whilst some laughed, and others were indignant at the
interruption, the astrologer exclaimed "that the happy moment was come;"
on which an old officer carried three white stakes, like the palisades
of a town, and gave one to each of the brothers; and the ceremony was
thus concluded.</p>

<p>The countries which the three brothers shared amongst them comprehended
not only what was commonly called the Duchy, before the King of Sardinia
acquired a great part of it, but the territories of Parma, Piacenza,
Bologna, Lodi, Bobbio, Pontremoli, and many other places.</p>

<p>There was an entire dissimilarity among the brothers. Matteo hated
business, and was addicted to the grossest debaucheries. Barnabo was a
monster of tyranny and cruelty. Petrarch, nevertheless, condescended to
be godfather to one of Barnabo's sons, and presented the child with a
gilt cup. He also composed a Latin poem, on the occasion of his godson
being christened by the name of Marco, in which he passes in review all
the great men who had borne that name.</p>

<p>Galeazzo was very different from his brothers. He had much kindliness of
disposition. One of his greatest pleasures was his intercourse with men
of letters. He almost worshipped Petrarch, and it was his influence that
induced the poet to settle at Milan. Unlike as they were in
dispositions, the brothers, nevertheless, felt how important it was that
they should be united, in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</a></span> protect themselves against the
league which threatened them; and, at first, they lived in the greatest
harmony. Barnabo, the most warlike, was charged with whatever concerned
the military. Business of every other kind devolved on Galeazzo. Matteo,
as the eldest, presided over all; but, conscious of his incapacity, he
took little share in the deliberations of his brothers. Nothing
important was done without consulting Petrarch; and this flattering
confidence rendered Milan as agreeable to him as any residence could be,
consistently with his love of change.</p>

<p>The deaths of the Doge of Venice and of the Lord of Milan were soon
followed by another, which, if it had happened some years earlier, would
have strongly affected Petrarch. This was the tragic end of Rienzo. Our
poet's opinion of this extraordinary man had been changed by his later
conduct, and he now took but a comparatively feeble interest in him.
Under the pontificate of Clement VI., the ex-Tribune, after his fall,
had been consigned to a prison at Avignon. Innocent, the succeeding
Pope, thought differently of him from his predecessor, and sent the
Cardinal Albornoz into Italy, with an order to establish him at Rome,
and to confide the government of the city to him under the title of
senator. The Cardinal obeyed the injunction; but after a brief and
inglorious struggle with the faction of the Colonnas, Rienzo perished in
a popular sedition on the 8th of October, 1354.</p>

<p>War was now raging between the States of the Venetian League and Milan,
united with Genoa, when a new actor was brought upon the scene. The
Emperor, who had been solicited by one half of Italy to enter the
kingdom, but who hesitated from dread of the Lord of Milan, was
evidently induced by the intelligence of John Visconti's death to accept
this invitation. In October, 1354, his Imperial Majesty entered Italy,
with no show of martial preparation, being attended by only three
hundred horsemen. On the 10th of November he arrived at Mantua, where he
was received as sovereign. There he stopped for some time, before he
pursued his route to Rome.</p>

<p>The moment Petrarch heard of his arrival, he wrote to his Imperial
Majesty in transports of joy. "You are no longer," he said, "king of
Bohemia. I behold in you the king of the world, the Roman emperor, the
true C&aelig;sar." The Emperor received this letter at Mantua, and in a few
days sent Sacromore de Pomieres, one of his squires, to invite Petrarch
to come and meet him, expressing the utmost eagerness to see him.
Petrarch could not resist so flattering an invitation; he was not to be
deterred even by the unprecedented severity of the frost, and departed
from Milan on the 9th of December; but, with all the speed that he could
make, was not able to reach Mantua till the 12th.</p>

<p>The Emperor thanked him for having come to him in such dreadful weather,
the like of which he had scarcely ever felt, even in Germany. "The
Emperor," says Petrarch, "received me in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</a></span> a manner that partook neither
of imperial haughtiness nor of German etiquette. We passed sometimes
whole days together, from morning to night, in conversation, as if his
Majesty had had nothing else to do. He spoke to me about my works, and
expressed a great desire to see them, particularly my 'Treatise on
Illustrious Men.' I told him that I had not yet put my last hand to it,
and that, before I could do so, I required to have leisure and repose.
He gave me to understand that he should be very glad to see it appear
under his own patronage, that is to say, dedicated to himself. I said to
him, with that freedom of speech which Nature has given me, and which
years have fortified, 'Great prince, for this purpose, nothing more is
necessary than, virtue on your part, and leisure on mine.' He asked me
to explain myself. I said, 'I must have time for a work of this nature,
in which I propose to include great things in a small space. On your
part, labour to deserve that your name should appear at the head of my
book. For this end, it is not enough that you wear a crown; your virtues
and great actions must place you among the great men whose portraits I
have delineated. Live in such a manner, that, after reading the lives of
your illustrious predecessors, you may feel assured that your own life
shall deserve to be read by posterity.'</p>

<p>"The Emperor showed by a smile that my liberty had not displeased him, I
seized this opportunity of presenting him with some imperial medals, in
gold and in silver, and gave him a short sketch of the lives of those
worthies whose images they bore. He seemed to listen to me with
pleasure, and, graciously accepting the medals, declared that he never
had received a more agreeable present.</p>

<p>"I should never end if I were to relate to you all the conversations
which I held with this prince. He desired me one day to relate the
history of my life to him. I declined to do so at first; but he would
take no refusal, and I obeyed him. He heard me with attention, and, if I
omitted any circumstances from forgetfulness or the fear of being
wearisome, he brought them back to my memory. He then asked me what were
my projects for the future, and my plans for the rest of my life. 'My
intentions are good,' I replied to him, 'but a bad habit, which I cannot
conquer, masters my better will, and I resemble a sea beaten by two
opposite winds,' 'I can understand that,' he said; 'but I wish to know
what is the kind of life that would most decidedly please you?' 'A
secluded life,' I replied to him, without hesitation. 'If I could, I
should go and seek for such a life at its fountain-head; that is, among
the woods and mountains, as I have already done. If I could not go so
far to find it, I should seek to enjoy it in the midst of cities.'</p>

<p>"The Emperor differed from me totally as to the benefits of a solitary
life. I told him that I had composed a treatise on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[Pg ci]</a></span> subject. 'I know
that,' said the Emperor; 'and if I ever find your book, I shall throw it
into the fire.' 'And,' I replied, 'I shall take care that it never falls
into your hands.' On this subject we had long and frequent disputes,
always seasoned with pleasantry. I must confess that the Emperor
combated my system on a solitary life with surprising energy."</p>

<p>Petrarch remained eight days with the King of Bohemia, at Mantua, where
he was witness to all his negotiations with the Lords of the league of
Lombardy, who came to confer with his Imperial Majesty, in that city, or
sent thither their ambassadors. The Emperor, above all things, wished to
ascertain the strength of this confederation; how much each principality
would contribute, and how much might be the sum total of the whole
contribution. The result of this inquiry was, that the forces of the
united confederates were not sufficient to make head against the
Visconti, who had thirty thousand well-disciplined men. The Emperor,
therefore, decided that it was absolutely necessary to conclude a peace.
This prince, pacific and without ambition, had, indeed, come into Italy
with this intention; and was only anxious to obtain two crowns without
drawing a sword. He saw, therefore, with satisfaction that there was no
power in Italy to protract hostilities by strengthening the coalition.</p>

<p>He found difficulties, however, in the settlement of a general peace.
The Viscontis felt their superiority; and the Genoese, proud of a
victory which they had obtained over the Venetians, insisted on hard
terms. The Emperor, more intent upon his personal interests than the
good of Italy, merely negotiated a truce between the belligerents. He
prevailed upon the confederates to disband the company of Count Lando,
which cost much and effected little. It cannot be doubted that Petrarch
had considerable influence in producing this dismissal, as he always
held those troops of mercenaries in abhorrence. The truce being signed,
his Imperial Majesty had no further occupation than to negotiate a
particular agreement with the Viscontis, who had sent the chief men of
Milan, with presents, to conclude a treaty with him. No one appeared
more fit than Petrarch to manage this negotiation, and it was
universally expected that it should be entrusted to him; but particular
reasons, which Petrarch has not thought proper to record, opposed the
desires of the Lords of Milan and the public wishes.</p>

<p>The negotiation, nevertheless, was in itself a very easy one. The
Emperor, on the one hand, had no wish to make war for the sake of being
crowned at Monza. On the other hand, the Viscontis were afraid of seeing
the league of their enemies fortified by imperial power. They took
advantage of the desire which they observed in Charles to receive this
crown without a struggle. They promised not to oppose his coronation,
and even to give 50,000 florins for the expense of the ceremony; but
they required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[Pg cii]</a></span> that he should not enter the city of Milan, and that the
troops in his suite should be disarmed.</p>

<p>To these humiliating terms Charles subscribed. The affair was completed
during the few days that Petrarch spent at Mantua. The Emperor strongly
wished that he should be present at the signature of the treaty; and, in
fact, though he was not one of the envoys from Milan, the success of the
negotiation was generally attributed to him. A rumour to this effect
reached even Avignon, where L&aelig;lius then was. He wrote to Petrarch to
compliment him on the subject. The poet, in his answer, declines an
honour that was not due to him.</p>

<p>After the signature of the treaty, Petrarch departed for Milan, where he
arrived on Christmas eve, 1354. He there found four letters from Zanobi
di Strata, from whom he had not had news for two years. Curious persons
had intercepted their letters to each other. Petrarch often complains of
this nuisance, which was common at the time.</p>

<p>The Emperor set out from Mantua after the festivities of Christmas. On
arriving at the gates of Milan, he was invited to enter by the
Viscontis; but Charles declined their invitation, saying, that he would
keep the promise which he had pledged. The Viscontis told him politely
that they asked his entrance as a favour, and that the precaution
respecting his troops by no means extended to his personal presence,
which they should always consider an honour. The Emperor entered Milan
on the 4th of January, 1355. He was received with the sound of drums,
trumpets, and other instruments, that made such a din as to resemble
thunder. "His entry," says Villani, "had the air of a tempest rather
than of a festivity." Meanwhile the gates of Milan were shut and
strictly guarded. Shortly after his arrival, the three brothers came to
tender their homage, declaring that they held of the Holy Empire all
that they possessed, and that they would never employ their possessions
but for his service.</p>

<p>Next day the three brothers, wishing to give the Emperor a high idea of
their power and forces, held a grand review of their troops, horse and
foot; to which, in order to swell the number, they added companies of
the burgesses, well mounted, and magnificently dressed; and they
detained his poor Majesty at a window, by way of amusing him, all the
time they were making this display of their power. Whilst the troops
were defiling, they bade him look upon the six thousand cavalry and ten
thousand infantry, which they kept in their pay for his service, adding
that their fortresses and castles were well furnished and garrisoned.
This spectacle was anything but amusing to the Emperor; but he put a
good countenance on the matter, and appeared cheerful and serene.
Petrarch scarcely ever quitted his side; and the Prince conversed with
him whenever he could snatch time from business, and from the rigid
ceremonials that were imposed on him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[Pg ciii]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th of January, the festival of Epiphany, Charles received at
Milan the iron crown, in the church of St. Ambrosio, from the hands of
Robert Visconti, Archbishop of Milan. They gave the Emperor fifty
thousand florins in gold, two hundred beautiful horses, covered with
cloth bordered with ermine, and six hundred horsemen to escort him to
Rome.</p>

<p>The Emperor, who regarded Milan only as a fine large prison, got out of
it as soon as he could. Petrarch accompanied him as far as five miles
beyond P&igrave;acenza, but refused to comply with the Emperor's solicitations
to continue with him as far as Rome.</p>

<p>The Emperor departed from Sienna the 28th of March, with the Empress and
all his suite. On the 2nd of April he arrived at Rome. During the next
two days he visited the churches in pilgrim's attire. On Sunday, which
was Easter day, he was crowned, along with his Empress; and, on this
occasion, he confirmed all the privileges of the Roman Church, and all
the promises that he had made to the Popes Clement VI. and Innocent VI.
One of those promises was, that he should not enter Rome except upon the
day of his coronation, and that he should not sleep in the city. He kept
his word most scrupulously. After leaving the church of St. Peter, he
went with a grand retinue to St. John's di Latrana, where he dined, and,
in the evening, under pretext of a hunting-party, he went and slept at
St. Lorenzo, beyond the walls.</p>

<p>The Emperor arrived at Sienna on the 29th of April. He had there many
conferences with the Cardinal Albornoz, to whom he promised troops for
the purpose of reducing the tyrants with whom the Legate was at war. His
Majesty then went to Pisa, where, on the 21st of May, 1355, a sedition
broke out against him, which nearly cost him his life. He left Tuscany
without delay, with his Empress and his whole suite, to return to
Germany, where he arrived early in June. Many were the affronts he met
with on his route, and he recrossed the Alps, as Villani says, "with his
dignity humbled, though with his purse well filled."</p>

<p>L&aelig;lius, who had accompanied the Emperor as far as Cremona, quitted him
at that place, and went to Milan, where he delivered to Petrarch the
Prince's valedictory compliments. Petrarch's indignation, at his
dastardly flight vented itself in a letter to his Imperial Majesty
himself, so full of unmeasured rebuke, that it is believed it was never
sent.</p>

<p>Shortly after the departure of the Emperor, Petrarch had the
satisfaction of hearing, in his own church of St. Ambrosio, the
publication of a peace between the Venetians and Genoese. It was
concluded at Milan by the mediation of the Visconti, entirely to the
advantage of the Genoese, to whom their victory gained in the gulf of
Sapienza had given an irresistible superiority. It cost the Venetians
two hundred thousand florins. Whilst the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</a></span> treaty of peace was
proceeding, Venice witnessed the sad and strange spectacle of Marino
Faliero, her venerable Doge, four-score years old, being dragged to a
public execution. Some obscurity still hangs over the true history of
this affair. Petrarch himself seems to have understood it but
imperfectly, though, from his personal acquaintance with Faliero, and
his humane indignation at seeing an old man whom he believed to be
innocent, hurled from his seat of power, stripped of his ducal robes,
and beheaded like the meanest felon, he inveighs against his execution
as a public murder, in his letter on the subject to Guido Settimo.</p>

<p>Petrarch, since his establishment at Milan, had thought it his duty to
bring thither his son John, that he might watch over his education. John
was at this time eighteen years of age, and was studying at Verona.</p>

<p>The September of 1355 was a critical month for our poet. It was then
that the tertian ague commonly attacked him, and this year it obliged
him to pass a whole month in bed. He was just beginning to be
convalescent, when, on the 9th of September, 1355, a friar, from the
kingdom of Naples, entered his chamber, and gave him a letter from
Barbato di Salmone. This was a great joy to him, and tended to promote
the recovery of his health. Their correspondence had been for a long
time interrupted by the wars, and the unsafe state of the public roads.
This letter was full of enthusiasm and affection, and was addressed to
<i>Francis Petrarch, the king of poets</i>. The friar had told Barbato that
this title was given to Petrarch over all Italy. Our poet in his answer
affected to refuse it with displeasure as far beyond his deserts. "There
are only two king-poets," he says, "the one in Greece, the other in
Italy. The old bard of M&aelig;onia occupies the former kingdom, the shepherd
of Mantua is in possession of the latter. As for me, I can only reign in
my transalpine solitude and on the banks of the Sorgue."</p>

<p>Petrarch continued rather languid during autumn, but his health was
re-established before the winter.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1356, whilst war was raging between Milan and the
Lombard and Ligurian league, a report was spread that the King of
Hungary had formed a league with the Emperor and the Duke of Austria, to
invade Italy. The Italians in alarm sent ambassadors to the King of
Hungary, who declared that he had no hostile intentions, except against
the Venetians, as they had robbed him of part of Sclavonia. This
declaration calmed the other princes, but not the Viscontis, who knew
that the Emperor would never forget the manner in which they had treated
him. They thought that it would be politic to send an ambassador to
Charles, in order to justify themselves before him, or rather to
penetrate into his designs, and no person seemed to be more fit for this
commission than Petrarch. Our poet had no great desire to journey into
the north, but a charge so agreeable and flattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</a></span> made him overlook
the fatigue of travelling. He wrote thus to Simonides on the day before
his departure:&mdash;"They are sending me to the north, at the time when I am
sighing for solitude and repose. But man was made for toil: the charge
imposed on me does not displease me, and I shall be recompensed for my
fatigue if I succeed in the object of my mission. The Lord of Liguria
sends me to treat with the Emperor. After having conferred with him on
public affairs, I reckon on being able to treat with him respecting my
own, and be my own ambassador. I have reproached this prince by letter
with his shameful flight from our country. I shall make him the same
reproaches, face to face, and <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>. In thus using <i>my own</i>
liberty and his patience, I shall avenge at once Italy, the empire, and
my own person. At my return I shall bury myself in a solitude so
profound that toil and envy will not be able to find me out. Yet what
folly! Can I flatter myself to find any place where envy cannot
penetrate?"</p>

</div>

<p>Next day he departed with Sacromoro di Pomieres, whose company was a
great solace to him. They arrived at Basle, where the Emperor was
expected; but they waited in vain for him a whole month. "This prince,"
says Petrarch, "finishes nothing; one must go and seek him in the depths
of barbarism." It was fortunate for him that he stayed no longer, for, a
few days after he took leave of Basle, the city was almost wholly
destroyed by an earthquake.</p>

<p>Petrarch arrived at Prague in Bohemia towards the end of July, 1356. He
found the Emperor wholly occupied with that famous Golden Bull, the
provisions of which he settled with the States, at the diet of
Nuremberg, and which he solemnly promulgated at another grand diet held
at Christmas, in the same year. This Magna Charta of the Germanic
constitution continued to be the fundamental law of the empire till its
dissolution.</p>

<p>Petrarch made but a short stay at Prague, notwithstanding his Majesty's
wish to detain him. The Emperor, though sorely exasperated against the
Visconti, had no thoughts of carrying war into Italy. His affairs in
Germany employed him sufficiently, besides the embellishment of the city
of Prague. At the Bohemian court our poet renewed a very amicable
acquaintance with two accomplished prelates, Ernest, Archbishop of
Pardowitz, and John Oczkow, Bishop of Olm&uuml;tz. Of these churchmen he
speaks in the warmest terms, and he afterwards corresponded with them.
We find him returned to Milan, and writing to Simonides on the 20th of
September.</p>

<p>Some days after Petrarch's return from Germany, a courier arrived at
Milan with news of the battle of Poitiers, in which eighty thousand
French were defeated by thirty thousand Englishmen, and in which King
John of France was made prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[Pg cvi]</a></span> Petrarch was requested by Galeazzo
Visconti on this occasion to write for him two condoling letters, one to
Charles the Dauphin, and another to the Cardinal of Boulogne. Petrarch
was thunderstruck at the calamity of King John, of whom he had an
exalted idea. "It is a thing," he says, "incredible, unheard-of, and
unexampled in history, that an invincible hero, the greatest king that
ever lived, should have been conquered and made captive by an enemy so
inferior."</p>

<p>On this great event, our poet composed an allegorical eclogue, in which
the King of France, under the name of Pan, and the King of England,
under that of Articus, heartily abuse each other. The city of Avignon is
brought in with the designation of Faustula. England reproaches the Pope
with his partiality for the King of France, to whom he had granted the
tithes of his kingdom, by which means he was enabled to levy an army.
Articus thus apostrophizes Faustula:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah meretrix oblique tuens, ait Articus illi&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But in my foe's embraces spent the night.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Marquard, Bishop of Augsburg, vicar of the Emperor in Italy,
having put himself at the head of the Lombard league against the
Viscontis, entered their territories with the German troops, and was
committing great devastations. But the brothers of Milan turned out,
beat the Bishop, and took him prisoner. It is evident, from these
hostilities of the Emperor's vicar against the Viscontis, that
Petrarch's embassy to Prague had not had the desired success. The
Emperor, it is true, plainly told him that he had no thoughts of
invading Italy in person. And this was true; but there is no doubt that
he abetted and secretly supported the enemies of the Milan chiefs.
Powerful as the Visconti were, their numerous enemies pressed them hard;
and, with war on all sides, Milan was in a critical situation. But
Petrarch, whilst war was at the very gates, continued retouching his
Italian poetry.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this year, 1356, he received a letter from
Avignon, which Socrates, L&aelig;lius, and Guido Settimo had jointly written
to him. They dwelt all three in the same house, and lived in the most
social union. Petrarch made them a short reply, in which he said,
"Little did I think that I should ever envy those who inhabit Babylon.
Nevertheless, I wish that I were with you in that house of yours,
inaccessible to the pestilent air of the infamous city. I regard it as
an elysium in the midst of Avernus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg cvii]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, Petrarch received a diploma that was sent to him by John,
Bishop of Olm&uuml;tz, Chancellor of the Empire, in which diploma the Emperor
created him a count palatine, and conferred upon him the rights and
privileges attached to this dignity. These, according to the French
abridger of the History of Germany, consisted in creating doctors and
notaries, in legitimatizing the bastards of citizens, in crowning poets,
in giving dispensations with respect to age, and in other things. To
this diploma sent to Petrarch was attached a bull, or capsule of gold.
On one side was the impression of the Emperor, seated on his throne,
with an eagle and lion beside him; on the other was the city of Rome,
with its temples and walls. The Emperor had added to this dignity
privileges which he granted to very few, and the Chancellor, in his
communication, used very flattering terms. Petrarch says, in his letter
of thanks, "I am exceedingly grateful for the signal distinction which
the Emperor has graciously vouchsafed to me, and for the obliging terms
with which you have seasoned the communication. I have never sought in
vain for anything from his Imperial Majesty and yourself. But I wish not
for your gold."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1357, Petrarch, wishing to screen himself from the
excessive heat, took up his abode for a time on the banks of the Adda at
Garignano, a village three miles distant from Milan, of which he gives a
charming description. "The village," he says, "stands on a slight
elevation in the midst of a plain, surrounded on all sides by springs
and streams, not rapid and noisy like those of Vaucluse, but clear and
modest. They wind in such a manner, that you know not either whither
they are going, or whence they have come. As if to imitate the dances of
the nymphs, they approach, they retire, they unite, and they separate
alternately. At last, after having formed a kind of labyrinth, they all
meet, and pour themselves into the same reservoir." John Visconti had
chosen this situation whereon to build a Carthusian monastery. This was
what tempted Petrarch to found here a little establishment. He wished at
first to live within the walls of the monastery, and the Carthusians
made him welcome to do so; but he could not dispense with servants and
horses, and he feared that the drunkenness of the former might trouble
the silence of the sacred retreat. He therefore hired a house in the
neighbourhood of the holy brothers, to whom he repaired at all hours of
the day. He called this house his Linterno, in memory of Scipio
Africanus, whose country-house bore that name. The peasants, hearing him
call the domicile <i>Linterno</i>, corrupted the word into <i>Inferno</i>, and,
from this mispronunciation, the place was often jocularly called by that
name.</p>

<p>Petrarch was scarcely settled in this agreeable solitude, when he
received a letter from his friend Settimo, asking him for an exact and
circumstantial detail of his circumstances and mode of living, of his
plans and occupations, of his son John, &amp;c. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</a></span> answer was prompt, and
is not uninteresting. "The course of my life," he says, "has always been
uniform ever since the frost of age has quenched the ardour of my youth,
and particularly that fatal flame which so long tormented me. But what
do I say?" he continues; "it is a celestial dew which has produced this
extinction. Though I have often changed my place of abode, I have always
led nearly the same kind of life. What it is, none knows better than
yourself. I once lived beside you for two years. Call to mind how I was
then occupied, and you will know my present occupations. You understand
me so well that you ought to be able to guess, not only what I am doing,
but what I am dreaming.</p>

<p>"Like a traveller, I am quickening my steps in proportion as I approach
the term of my course. I read and write night and day; the one
occupation refreshes me from the fatigue of the other These are my
employments&mdash;these are my pleasures. My tasks increase upon my hands;
one begets another; and I am dismayed when I look at what I have
undertaken to accomplish in so short a space as the remainder of my
life. * * * My health is good; my body is so robust that neither ripe
years, nor grave occupations, nor abstinence, nor penance, can totally
subdue that <i>kicking ass</i> on whom I am constantly making war. I count
upon the grace of Heaven, without which I should infallibly fall, as I
fell in other times. All my reliance is on Christ. With regard to my
fortune, I am exactly in a just mediocrity, equally distant from the two
extremes * * * *</p>

<p>"I inhabit a retired corner of the city towards the west. Their ancient
devotion attracts the people every Sunday to the church of St. Ambrosio,
near which I dwell. During the rest of the week, this quarter is a
desert.</p>

<p>"Fortune has changed nothing in my nourishment, or my hours of sleep,
except that I retrench as much as possible from indulgence in either. I
lie in bed for no other purpose than to sleep, unless I am ill. I hasten
from bed as soon as I am awake, and pass into my library. This takes
place about the middle of the night, save when the nights are shortest.
I grant to Nature nothing but what she imperatively demands, and which
it is impossible to refuse her.</p>

<p>"Though I have always loved solitude and silence, I am a great gossip
with my friends, which arises, perhaps, from my seeing them but rarely.
I atone for this loquacity by a year of taciturnity. I mutely recall my
parted friends by correspondence. I resemble that class of people of
whom Seneca speaks, who seize life in detail, and not by the gross. The
moment I feel the approach of summer, I take a country-house a league
distant from town, where the air is extremely pure. In such a place I am
at present, and here I lead my wonted life, more free than ever from the
wearisomeness of the city. I have abundance of everything; the peasants
vie with each other in bringing me fruit, fish, ducks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[Pg cix]</a></span> and all sorts of
game. There is a beautiful Carthusian monastery in my neighbourhood,
where, at all hours of the day, I find the innocent pleasures which
religion offers. In this sweet retreat I feel no want but that of my
ancient friends. In these I was once rich; but death has taken away some
of them, and absence robs me of the remainder. Though my imagination
represents them, still I am not the less desirous of their real
presence. There would remain but few things for me to desire, if fortune
would restore to me but two friends, such as you and Socrates. I confess
that I flattered myself a long time to have had you both with me. But,
if you persist in your rigour, I must console myself with the company of
my religionists. Their conversation, it is true, is neither witty nor
profound, but it is simple and pious. Those good priests will be of
great service to me both in life and death. I think I have now said
enough about myself, and, perhaps, more than enough. You ask me about
the state of my fortune, and you wish to know whether you may believe
the rumours that are abroad about my riches. It is true that my income
is increased; but so, also, proportionably, is my outlay. I am, as I
have always been, neither rich nor poor. Riches, they say, make men poor
by multiplying their wants and desires; for my part, I feel the
contrary; the more I have the less I desire. Yet, I suppose, if I
possessed great riches, they would have the same effect upon me as upon
other people.</p>

<p>"You ask news about my son. I know not very well what to say concerning
him. His manners are gentle, and the flower of his youth holds out a
promise, though what fruit it may produce I know not. I think I may
flatter myself that he will be an honest man. He has talent; but what
avails talent without study! He flies from a book as he would from a
serpent. Persuasions, caresses, and threats are all thrown away upon him
as incitements to study. I have nothing wherewith to reproach myself;
and I shall be satisfied if he turns out an honest man, as I hope he
will. Themistocles used to say that he liked a man without letters
better than letters without a man."</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1357, Petrarch received a letter from
Benintendi, the Chancellor of Venice, requesting him to send a dozen
elegiac verses to be engraved on the tomb of Andrea Dandolo. The
children of the Doge had an ardent wish that our poet should grant them
this testimony of his friendship for their father. Petrarch could not
refuse the request, and composed fourteen verses, which contain a sketch
of the great actions of Dandolo. But they were verses of command, which
the poet made in despite of the Muses and of himself.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1358, Petrarch was almost entirely occupied with
his treatise, entitled, "De Remediis utriusque Fortun&aelig;," (A Remedy
against either extreme of Fortune.) This made a great noise when it
appeared. Charles V. of France had it tran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx">[Pg cx]</a></span>scribed for his library, and
translated; and it was afterwards translated into Italian and Spanish.</p>

<p>Petrarch returned to Milan, and passed the autumn at his house, the
Linterno, where he met with an accident, that for some time threatened
dangerous consequences. He thus relates it, in a letter to his friend,
Neri Morandi:&mdash;"I have a great volume of the epistles of Cicero, which I
have taken the pains to transcribe myself, for the copyists understand
nothing. One day, when I was entering my library, my gown got entangled
with this large book, so that the volume fell heavily on my left leg, a
little above the heel. By some fatality, I treated the accident too
lightly. I walked, I rode on horseback, according to my usual custom;
but my leg became inflamed, the skin changed colour, and mortification
began to appear. The pain took away my cheerfulness and sleep. I then
perceived that it was foolish courage to trifle with so serious an
accident. Doctors were called in. They feared at first that it would be
necessary to amputate the limb; but, at last, by means of regimen and
fomentation, the afflicted member was put into the way of healing. It is
singular that, ever since my infancy, my misfortunes have always fallen
on this same left leg. In truth, I have always been tempted to believe
in destiny; and why not, if, by the word destiny, we understand
Providence?"</p>

<p>As soon as his leg was recovered, he made a trip to Bergamo. There was
in that city a jeweller named Enrico Capri, a man of great natural
talents, who cherished a passionate admiration for the learned, and
above all for Petrarch, whose likeness was pictured or statued in every
room of his house. He had copies made at a great expense of everything
that came from his pen. He implored Petrarch to come and see him at
Bergamo. "If he honours my household gods," he said, "but for a single
day with his presence, I shall be happy all my life, and famous through
all futurity." Petrarch consented, and on the 13th of October, 1358, the
poet was received at Bergamo with transports of joy. The governor of the
country and the chief men of the city wished to lodge him in some
palace; but Petrarch adhered to his jeweller, and would not take any
other lodging but with his friend.</p>

<p>A short time after his return to Milan, Petrarch had the pleasure of
welcoming to his house John Boccaccio, who passed some days with him.
The author of the Decamerone regarded Petrarch as his literary master.
He owed him a still higher obligation, according to his own statement;
namely, that of converting his heart, which, he says, had been frivolous
and inclined to gallantry, and even to licentiousness, until he received
our poet's advice. He was about forty-five years old when he went to
Milan. Petrarch made him sensible that it was improper, at his age, to
lose his time in courting women; that he ought to employ it more
seriously, and turn towards heaven, the devotion which he misplaced on
earthly beauties. This conversation is the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[Pg cxi]</a></span> of one of
Boccaccio's eclogues, entitled, "Philostropos." His eclogues are in the
style of Petrarch, obscure and enigmatical, and the subjects are muffled
up under emblems and Greek names.</p>

<p>After spending some days with Petrarch, that appeared short to them
both, Boccaccio, pressed by business, departed about the beginning of
April, 1359. The great novelist soon afterwards sent to Petrarch from
Florence a beautiful copy of Dante's poem, written in his own hand,
together with some indifferent Latin verses, in which he bestows the
highest praises on the author of the Inferno. At that time, half the
world believed that Petrarch was jealous of Dante's fame; and the rumour
was rendered plausible by the circumstance&mdash;for which he has accounted
very rationally&mdash;that he had not a copy of Dante in his library.</p>

<p>In the month of May in this year, 1359, a courier from Bohemia brought
Petrarch a letter from the Empress Anne, who had the condescension to
write to him with her own hand to inform him that she had given birth to
a daughter. Great was the joy on this occasion, for the Empress had been
married five years, but, until now, had been childless. Petrarch, in his
answer, dated the 23rd of the same month, after expressing his sense of
the honour which her Imperial Majesty had done him, adds some
common-places, and seasons them with his accustomed pedantry. He
pronounces a grand eulogy on the numbers of the fair sex who had
distinguished themselves by their virtues and their courage. Among these
he instances Isis, Carmenta, the mother of Evander, Sappho, the Sybils,
the Amazons, Semiramis, Tomiris, Cleopatra, Zenobia, the Countess
Matilda, Lucretia, Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, Martia, Portia,
and Livia. The Empress Anne was no doubt highly edified by this
muster-roll of illustrious women; though some of the heroines, such as
Lucretia, might have bridled up at their chaste names being classed with
that of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>Petrarch repaired to Linterno, on the 1st of October, 1359; but his stay
there was very short. The winter set in sooner than usual. The constant
rains made his rural retreat disagreeable, and induced him to return to
the city about the end of the month.</p>

<p>On rising, one morning, soon after his return to Milan, he found that he
had been robbed of everything valuable in his house, excepting his
books. As it was a domestic robbery, he could accuse nobody of it but
his son John and his servants, the former of whom had returned from
Avignon. On this, he determined to quit his house at St. Ambrosio, and
to take a small lodging in the city; here, however, he could not live in
peace. His son and servants quarrelled every day, in his very presence,
so violently that they exchanged blows. Petrarch then lost all patience,
and turned the whole of his pugnacious inmates out of doors. His son
John had now become an arrant debauchee; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</a></span> it was undoubtedly to
supply his debaucheries that he pillaged his own father. He pleaded
strongly to be readmitted to his home; but Petrarch persevered for some
time in excluding him, though he ultimately took him back.</p>

<p>It appears from one of Petrarch's letters, that many people at Milan
doubted his veracity about the story of the robbery, alleging that it
was merely a pretext to excuse his inconstancy in quitting his house at
St. Ambrosio; but that he was capable of accusing his own son on false
grounds is a suspicion which the whole character of Petrarch easily
repels. He went and settled himself in the monastery of St. Simplician,
an abbey of the Benedictines of Monte Cassino, pleasantly situated
without the walls of the city.</p>

<p>He was scarcely established in his new home at St. Simplician's, when
Galeazzo Visconti arrived in triumph at Milan, after having taken
possession of Pavia. The capture of this city much augmented the power
of the Lords of Milan; and nothing was wanting to their satisfaction but
the secure addition to their dominions of Bologna, to which Barnabo
Visconti was laying siege, although John of Olegea had given it up to
the Church in consideration of a pension and the possession of the city
of Fermo.</p>

<p>This affair had thrown the court of Avignon into much embarrassment, and
the Pope requested Nicholas Acciajuoli, Grand Seneschal of Naples, who
had been sent to the Papal city by his Neapolitan Majesty, to return by
way of Milan, and there negotiate a peace between the Church and Barnabo
Visconti. Acciajuoli reached Milan at the end of May, very eager to see
Petrarch, of whom he had heard much, without having yet made his
acquaintance. Petrarch describes their first interview in a letter to
Zanobi da Strada, and seems to have been captivated by the gracious
manners of the Grand Seneschal.</p>

<p>With all his popularity, the Seneschal was not successful in his
mission. When the Seneschal's proposals were read to the impetuous
Barnabo, he said, at the end of every sentence "Io voglio Bologna." It
is said that Petrarch detached Galeazzo Visconti from the ambitious
projects of his brother; and that it was by our poet's advice that
Galeazzo made a separate peace with the Pope; though, perhaps, the true
cause of his accommodation with the Church was his being in treaty with
France and soliciting the French monarch's daughter, Isabella, in
marriage for his son Giovanni. After this marriage had been celebrated
with magnificent festivities, Petrarch was requested by Galeazzo to go
to Paris, and to congratulate the unfortunate King John upon his return
to his country. Our poet had a transalpine prejudice against France; but
he undertook this mission to its capital, and was deeply touched by its
unfortunate condition.</p>

<p>If the aspect of the country in general was miserable, that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii">[Pg cxiii]</a></span> the
capital was still worse. "Where is Paris," exclaims Petrarch, "that
metropolis, which, though inferior to its reputation, was, nevertheless,
a great city?" He tells us that its streets were covered with briars and
grass, and that it looked like a vast desert.</p>

<p>Here, however, in spite of its desolate condition, Petrarch witnessed
the joy with which the Parisians received their King John and the
Dauphin Charles. The King had not been well educated, yet he respected
literature and learned men. The Dauphin was an accomplished prince; and
our poet says that he was captivated by his modesty, sense, and
information.</p>

<p>Petrarch arrived at Milan early in March, 1361, bringing letters from
King John and his son the Dauphin, in which those princes entreat the
two Lords of Milan to persuade Petrarch by every means to come and
establish himself at their court. No sooner had he refused their
pressing invitations, than he received an equally earnest request from
the Emperor to accept his hospitality at Prague.</p>

<p>At this period, it had given great joy in Bohemia that the Empress had
produced a son, and that the kingdom now possessed an heir apparent. His
Imperial Majesty's satisfaction made him, for once, generous, and he
distributed rich presents among his friends. Nor was our poet forgotten
on this occasion. The Emperor sent him a gold embossed cup of admirable
workmanship, accompanied by a letter, expressing his high regard, and
repeating his request that he would pay him a visit in Germany. Petrarch
returned him a letter of grateful thanks, saying: "Who would not be
astonished at seeing transferred to my use a vase consecrated by the
mouth of C&aelig;sar? But I will not profane the sacred gift by the common use
of it. It shall adorn my table only on days of solemn festivity." With
regard to the Imperial invitation, he concludes a long apology for not
accepting it immediately, but promising that, as soon as the summer was
over, if he could find a companion for the journey, he would go to the
court of Prague, and remain as long as it pleased his Majesty, since the
presence of C&aelig;sar would console him for the absence of his books, his
friends, and his country. This epistle is dated July 17th, 1861.</p>

<p>Petrarch quitted Milan during this year, a removal for which various
reasons are alleged by his biographers, though none of them appear to me
quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>He had now a new subject of grief to descant upon. The Marquis of
Montferrat, unable to contend against the Visconti, applied to the Pope
for assistance. He had already made a treaty with the court of London,
by which it was agreed that a body of English troops were to be sent to
assist the Marquis against the Visconti. They entered Italy by Nice. It
was the first time that our countrymen had ever entered the Saturnian
land. They did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv">[Pg cxiv]</a></span> no credit to the English character for humanity, but
ravaged lands and villages, killing men and violating women. Their
general appellation was the bulldogs of England. What must have been
Petrarch's horror at these unkennelled hounds! In one of his letters he
vents his indignation at their atrocities; but, by-and-by, in the same
epistle, he glides into his bookworm habit of apostrophizing the ancient
heroes of Rome, Brutus, Camillus, and God knows how many more!</p>

<p>The plague now again broke out in Italy; and the English and other
predatory troops contributed much to spread its ravages. It extended to
many places; but most of all it afflicted Milan.</p>

<p>It is probable that these disasters were among the causes of Petrarch's
leaving Milan. He settled at Padua, when the plague had not reached it.
At this time, Petrarch lost his son John. Whether he died at Milan or at
Padua is not certain, but, wherever he died, it was most probably of the
plague. John had not quite attained his twenty-fourth year.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1361, he married his daughter Francesca, now near the
age of twenty, to Francesco di Brossano, a gentleman of Milan. Petrarch
speaks highly of his son-in-law's talents, and of the mildness of his
character. Boccaccio has drawn his portrait in the most pleasing
colours. Of the poet's daughter, also, he tells us, "that without being
handsome, she had a very agreeable face, and much resembled her father."
It does not seem that she inherited his genius; but she was an excellent
wife, a tender mother, and a dutiful daughter. Petrarch was certainly
pleased both with her and with his son-in-law; and, if he did not live
with the married pair, he was, at least, near them, and much in their
society.</p>

<p>When our poet arrived at Padua, Francesco di Carrara, the son of his
friend Jacopo, reigned there in peace and alone. He had inherited his
father's affection for Petrarch. Here, too, was his friend Pandolfo
Malatesta, one of the bravest condottieri of the fourteenth century, who
had been driven away from Milan by the rage and jealousy of Barnabo.</p>

<p>The plague, which still continued to infest Southern Europe in 1362, had
even in the preceding year deprived our poet of his beloved friend
Socrates, who died at Avignon. "He was," says Petrarch, "of all men the
dearest to my heart. His sentiments towards me never varied during an
acquaintance of thirty-one years."</p>

<p>The plague and war rendered Italy at this time so disagreeable to
Petrarch, that he resolved on returning to Vaucluse. He, therefore, set
out from Padua for Milan, on the 10th of January, 1362, reckoning that
when the cold weather was over he might depart from the latter place on
his route to Avignon. But when he reached Milan, he found that the state
of the country would not permit him to proceed to the Alps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv">[Pg cxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor of Germany now sent Petrarch a third letter of invitation to
come and see him, which our poet promised to accept; but alleged that he
was prevented by the impossibility of getting a safe passage. Boccaccio,
hearing that Petrarch meditated a journey to the far North, was much
alarmed, and reproached him for his intention of dragging the Muses into
Sarmatia, when Italy was the true Parnassus.</p>

<p>In June, 1362, the plague, which had begun its ravages at Padua, chased
Petrarch from that place, and he took the resolution of establishing
himself at Venice, which it had not reached. The course of the
pestilence, like that of the cholera, was not general, but unaccountably
capricious. Villani says that it acted like hail, which will desolate
fields to the right and left, whilst it spares those in the middle. The
war had not permitted our poet to travel either to Avignon or into
Germany. The plague had driven him out of Milan and Padua. "I am not
flying from death," he said, "but seeking repose."</p>

<p>Having resolved to repair to Venice, Petrarch as usual took his books
along with him. From one of his letters to Boccaccio, it appears that it
was his intention to bestow his library on some religious community,
but, soon after his arrival at Venice, he conceived the idea of offering
this treasure to the Venetian Republic. He wrote to the Government that
he wished the blessed Evangelist, St. Mark, to be the heir of those
books, on condition that they should all be placed in safety, that they
should neither be sold nor separated, and that they should be sheltered
from fire and water, and carefully preserved for the use and amusement
of the learned and noble in Venice. He expressed his hopes, at the same
time, that the illustrious city would acquire other trusts of the same
kind for the good of the public, and that the citizens who loved their
country, the nobles above all, and even strangers, would follow his
example in bequeathing books to the church of St. Mark, which might one
day contain a great collection similar to those of the ancients.</p>

<p>The procurators of the church of St. Mark having offered to defray the
expense of lodging and preserving his library, the republic decreed that
our poet's offer did honour to the Venetian state. They assigned to
Petrarch for his own residence a large palace, called the Two Towers,
formerly belonging to the family of Molina. The mansion was very lofty,
and commanded a prospect of the harbour. Our poet took great pleasure in
this view, and describes it with vivid interest. "From this port," he
says, "I see vessels departing, which are as large as the house I
inhabit, and which have masts taller than its towers. These ships
resemble a mountain floating on the sea; they go to all parts of the
world amidst a thousand dangers; they carry our wines to the English,
our honey to the Scythians, our saffron, our oils, and our linen to the
Syrians, Armenians, Persians, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi">[Pg cxvi]</a></span> Arabians; and, wonderful to say,
convey our wood to the Greeks and Egyptians. From all these countries
they bring back in return articles of merchandise, which they diffuse
over all Europe. They go even as far as the Tanais. The navigation of
our seas does not extend farther north; but, when they have arrived
there, they quit their vessels, and travel on to trade with India and
China; and, after passing the Caucasus and the Ganges, they proceed as
far as the Eastern Ocean."</p>

<p>It is natural to suppose that Petrarch took all proper precautions for
the presentation of his books; nevertheless, they are not now to be seen
at Venice. Tomasini tells us that they had been placed at the top of the
church of St. Mark, that he demanded a sight of them, but that he found
them almost entirely spoiled, and some of them even petrified.</p>

<p>Whilst Petrarch was forming his new establishment at Venice, the news
arrived that Pope Innocent VI. had died on the 12th of September. "He
was a good, just, and simple man," says the continuator of Nangis. A
simple man he certainly was, for he believed Petrarch to be a sorcerer
on account of his reading Virgil. Innocent was succeeded in the
pontificate, to the surprise of all the world, by William Grimoard,
abbot of St. Victor at Marseilles, who took the title of Urban V. The
Cardinals chose him, though he was not of their Sacred College, from
their jealousy lest a pope should be elected from the opposite party of
their own body. Petrarch rejoiced at his election, and ascribed it to
the direct interference of Heaven. De Sade says that the new Pope
desired Petrarch to be the apostolic secretary, but that he was not to
be tempted by a gilded chain.</p>

<p>About this time Petrarch received news of the death of Azzo Correggio,
one of his dearest friends, whose widow and children wrote to him on
this occasion, the latter telling him that they regarded him as a
father.</p>

<p>Boccaccio came to Venice to see Petrarch in 1363, and their meeting was
joyous. They spent delightfully together the months of June, July, and
August, 1363. Boccaccio had not long left him, when, in the following
year, our poet heard of the death of his friend L&aelig;lius, and his tears
were still fresh for his loss, when he received another shock in being
bereft of Simonides. It requires a certain age and degree of experience
to appreciate this kind of calamity, when we feel the desolation of
losing our accustomed friends, and almost wish ourselves out of life
that we may escape from its solitude. Boccaccio returned to Florence
early in September, 1363.</p>

<p>In 1364, peace was concluded between Barnabo Visconti and Urban V.
Barnabo having refused to treat with the Cardinal Albornoz, whom he
personally hated, his Holiness sent the Cardinal Androine de la Roche to
Italy as his legate. Petrarch repaired to Bologna to pay his respects to
the new representative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii">[Pg cxvii]</a></span> of the Pope. He was touched by the sad condition
in which he found that city, which had been so nourishing when he
studied at its university. "I seem," he says, "to be in a dream when I
see the once fair city desolated by war, by slavery, and by famine.
Instead of the joy that once reigned here, sadness is everywhere spread,
and you hear only sighs and wailings in place of songs. Where you
formerly saw troops of girls dancing, there are now only bands of
robbers and assassins."</p>

<p>Lucchino del Verme, one of the most famous condottieri of his time, had
commanded troops in the service of the Visconti, at whose court he made
the acquaintance of Petrarch. Our poet invited him to serve the
Venetians in the war in which they were engaged with the people of
Candia. Lucchino went to Venice whilst Petrarch was absent, reviewed the
troops, and embarked for Candia on board the fleet, which consisted of
thirty galleys and eight large vessels. Petrarch did not return to
Venice till the expedition had sailed. He passed the summer in the
country, having at his house one of his friends, Barthelemi di
Pappazuori, Bishop of Christi, whom he had known at Avignon, and who had
come purposely to see him. One day, when they were both at a window
which overlooked the sea, they beheld one of the long vessels which the
Italians call a galeazza, entering the harbour. The green branches with
which it was decked, the air of joy that appeared among the mariners,
the young men crowned with laurel, who, from the prow, saluted the
standard of their country&mdash;everything betokened that the galeazza
brought good news. When the vessel came a little nearer, they could
perceive the captured colours of their enemies suspended from the poop,
and no doubt could be entertained that a great victory had been won. The
moment that the sentinel on the tower had made the signal of a vessel
entering the harbour, the people flocked thither in crowds, and their
joy was even beyond expectation when they learned that the rebellion had
been totally crushed, and the island reduced to obedience. The most
magnificent festivals were given at Venice on this occasion.</p>

<p>Shortly after these Venetian f&ecirc;tes, we find our poet writing a long
letter to Boccaccio, in which he gives a curious and interesting
description of the Jongleurs of Italy. He speaks of them in a very
different manner from those pictures that have come down to us of the
Proven&ccedil;al Troubadours. The latter were at once poets and musicians, who
frequented the courts and castles of great lords, and sang their
praises. Their strains, too, were sometimes satirical. They amused
themselves with different subjects, and wedded their verses to the sound
of the harp and other instruments. They were called Troubadours from the
word <i>trobar</i>, "to invent." They were original poets, of the true
minstrel breed, similar to those whom Bishop Percy ascribes to England
in the olden time, but about the reality of whom, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii">[Pg cxviii]</a></span> professional
body, Ritson has shown some cause to doubt. Of the Italian Jongleurs,
Petrarch gives us a humble notion. "They are a class," he says, "who
have little wit, but a great deal of memory, and still more impudence.
Having nothing of their own to recite, they snatch at what they can get
from others, and go about to the courts of princes to declaim verses, in
the vulgar tongue, which they have got by heart. At those courts they
insinuate themselves into the favour of the great, and get subsistence
and presents. They seek their means of livelihood, that is, the verses
they recite, among the best authors, from whom they obtain, by dint of
solicitation, and even by bribes of money, compositions for their
rehearsal. I have often repelled their importunities, but sometimes,
touched by their entreaties, I have spent hours in composing productions
for them. I have seen them leave me in rags and poverty, and return,
some time afterwards, clothed in silks, and with purses well furnished,
to thank me for having relieved them."</p>

<p>In the course of the same amusing correspondence with Boccaccio, which
our poet maintained at this period, he gives an account of an atheist
and blasphemer at Venice, with whom he had a long conversation. It ended
in our poet seizing the infidel by the mantle, and ejecting him from his
house with unceremonious celerity. This conclusion of their dialogue
gives us a higher notion of Petrarch's piety than of his powers of
argument.</p>

<p>Petrarch went to spend the autumn of 1365 at Pavia, which city Galeazzo
Visconti made his principal abode. To pass the winter till Easter, our
poet returned first to Venice, and then to Padua, according to his
custom, to do the duties of his canonry. It was then that his native
Florence, wishing to recall a man who did her so much honour, thought of
asking for him from the Pope the canonry of either Florence or Fiesole.
Petrarch fully appreciated the shabby kindness of his countrymen. A
republic that could afford to be lavish in all other expenses, limited
their bounty towards him to the begging of a canonicate for him from his
Holiness, though Florence had confiscated his father's property. But the
Pope had other views for him, and had actually appointed him to the
canonry of Carpentras, when a false rumour of his death unhappily
induced the Pontiff to dispose not only of that living, but of Parma and
others which he had resigned to indigent friends.</p>

<p>During the February of 1366 there was great joy in the house of
Petrarch, for his daughter, Francesca, the wife of Francesco di
Brossano, gave birth to a boy, whom Donato degli Albanzani, a
peculiarly-favoured friend of the poet's, held over the baptismal font,
whilst he was christened by the name of Francesco.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our poet was delighted to hear of reformations in the Church,
which signalized the commencement of Urban V.'s pontificate. After some
hesitation, Petrarch ventured to write a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix">[Pg cxix]</a></span> strong advice to the Pope to
remove the holy seat from Avignon to Rome. His letter is long, zealous,
superstitious, and, as usual, a little pedantic. The Pope did not need
this epistle to spur his intentions as to replacing the holy seat at
Rome; but it so happened that he did make the removal no very long time
after Petrarch had written to him.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July, 1366, our poet rose, as was his custom, to his
matin devotions, and reflected that he was precisely then entering on
his sixty-third year. He wrote to Boccaccio on the subject. He repeats
the belief, at that time generally entertained, that the sixty-third
year of a man's life is its most dangerous crisis. It was a belief
connected with astrology, and a superstitious idea of the influence of
numbers; of course, if it retains any attention at present, it must
subsist on practical observation: and I have heard sensible physicians,
who had no faith in the influence of the stars, confess that they
thought that time of life, commonly called the grand climacteric, a
critical period for the human constitution.</p>

<p>In May, 1367, Pope Urban accomplished his determination to remove his
court from Avignon in spite of the obstinacy of his Cardinals; but he
did not arrive at Rome till the month of October. He was joyously
received by the Romans; and, in addition to other compliments, had a
long letter from Petrarch, who was then at Venice. Some days after the
date of this letter, our poet received one from Galeazzo Visconti. The
Pope, it seems, wished, at whatever price, to exterminate the Visconti.
He thundered this year against Barnabo with a terrible bull, in which he
published a crusade against him. Barnabo, to whom, with all his faults,
the praise of courage cannot be denied, brought down his troops from the
Po, in order to ravage Mantua, and to make himself master of that city.
Galeazzo, his brother, less warlike, thought of employing negotiation
for appeasing the storm; and he invited Petrarch to Pavia, whither our
poet arrived in 1368. He attempted to procure a peace for the Visconti,
but was not successful.</p>

<p>It was not, however, solely to treat for a peace with his enemies that
Galeazzo drew our poet to his court. He was glad that he should be
present at the marriage of his daughter Violante with Lionel, Duke of
Clarence, son of Edward III. of England. The young English prince,
followed by many nobles of our land, passed through France, and arrived
at Milan on the 14th of May. His nuptials took place about a month
later. At the marriage-dinner Petrarch was seated at the table where
there were only princes, or nobles of the first rank. It is a curious
circumstance that Froissart, so well known as an historian of England,
came at this time to Milan, in the suite of the Duke of Clarence, and
yet formed no acquaintance with our poet. Froissart was then only about
thirty years old. It might have been hoped that the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxx" id="Page_cxx">[Pg cxx]</a></span> geniuses would
have become intimate friends; but there is no trace of their having even
spoken to each other. Petrarch's neglect of Froissart may not have been
so wonderful; but it is strange that the latter should not have been
ambitious to pay his court to the greatest poet then alive. It is
imaginable, however, that Petrarch, with all his natural gentleness, was
proud in his demeanour to strangers; and if so, Froissart was excusable
for an equally-proud reserve.</p>

<p>In the midst of the f&ecirc;tes that were given for the nuptials of the
English prince, Petrarch received news of the death of his grandchild.
This little boy had died at Pavia, on the very day of the marriage of
Lionel and Violante, when only two years and four months old. Petrarch
caused a marble mausoleum to be erected over him, and twelve Latin lines
of his own composition to be engraved upon it. He was deeply touched by
the loss of his little grandson. "This child," he says, "had a singular
resemblance to me, insomuch that any one who had not seen its mother
would have taken me for its father."</p>

<p>A most interesting letter from Boccaccio to our poet found Petrarch at
Pavia, whither he had retired from Milan, wearied with the marriage
f&ecirc;tes. The summer season was now approaching, when he was accustomed to
be ill; and he had, besides, got by the accident of a fall a bad
contusion on his leg. He was anxious to return to Padua, and wished to
embark on the Po. But war was abroad; the river banks were crowded with
troops of the belligerent parties; and no boatmen could be found for
some time who would go with him for love or money. At last, he found the
master of a vessel bold enough to take him aboard. Any other vessel
would have been attacked and pillaged; but Petrarch had no fear; and,
indeed, he was stopped in his river passage only to be loaded with
presents. He arrived in safety at Padua, on the 9th of June, 1368.</p>

<p>The Pope wished much to see our poet at Rome; but Petrarch excused
himself on account of his health and the summer season, which was always
trying to him. But he promised to repair to his Holiness as soon as his
health should permit, not to ask benefices of the holy father, but only
his blessing. During the same year, we find Petrarch complaining often
and painfully of his bodily infirmities. In a letter to Coluccio
Salutati, he says:&mdash;"Age, which makes others garrulous, only makes me
silent. When young, I used to write many and long letters. At present, I
write only to my particular friends, and even to them very short
letters." Petrarch was now sixty-four years old. He had never seen Pope
Urban V., as he tells us himself; but he was very desirous of seeing
him, and of seeing Rome adorned by the two great luminaries of the
world, the Pope and the Emperor. Pope Urban, fearing the heats of Italy,
to which he was not accustomed, had gone to pass the dog-days at
Monte-Fiascone. When he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxi" id="Page_cxxi">[Pg cxxi]</a></span> returned to Rome, in October, on his arrival at
the Colline gate, near the church of St. Angelo, he found the Emperor,
who was waiting for him. The Emperor, the moment he saw his Holiness,
dismounted from his horse, took the reins of that of the Pope, and
conducted him on foot to the church of St. Peter. As to this submission
of civil to ecclesiastical dignity, different opinions were entertained,
even at Rome; and the wiser class of men disapproved of it. Petrarch's
opinion on the subject is not recorded; but, during this year, there is
no proof that he had any connection with the Emperor; and my own opinion
is that he did not approve of his conduct. It is certain that Petrarch
condemned the Pope's entering Rome at the head of 2000 soldiery. "The
Roman Pontiff," he remarks, "should trust to his dignity and to his
sanctity, when coming into our capital, and not to an army with their
swords and cuirasses. The cross of Jesus is the only standard which he
ought to rear. Trumpets and drums were out of place. It would have been
enough to have sung hallelujahs."</p>

<p>Petrarch, in his letter to Boccaccio, in the month of September, says
that he had got the fever; and he was still so feeble that he was
obliged to employ the hand of a stranger in writing to him. He indites
as follows:&mdash;"I have had the fever for forty days. It weakened me so
much that I could not go to my church, though it is near my house,
without being carried. I feel as if my health would never be restored.
My constitution seems to be entirely worn out." In another letter to the
Cardinal Cabassole, who informed him of the Pope's wish to see him, he
says: "His Holiness does me more honour than I deserve. It is to you
that I owe this obligation. Return a thousand thanks to the holy father
in your own name and in mine." The Pope was so anxious to see Petrarch
that he wrote to him with his own hand, reproaching him for refusing his
invitation. Our poet, after returning a second apology, passed the
winter in making preparations for this journey; but before setting out
he thought proper to make his will. It was written with his own hand at
Padua.</p>

<p>In his testament he forbids weeping for his death, justly remarking that
tears do no good to the dead, and may do harm to the living. He asks
only prayers and alms to the poor who will pray for him. "As for my
burial," he says, "let it be made as my friends think fit. What
signifies it to me where my body is laid?" He then makes some bequests
in favour of the religious orders; and he founds an anniversary in his
own church of Padua, which is still celebrated every year on the 9th of
July.</p>

<p>Then come his legacies to his friends. He bequeathes to the Lord of
Padua his picture of the Virgin, painted by Giotto; "the beauty of
which," he says, "is little known to the ignorant, though the masters of
art will never look upon it without admiration."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxii" id="Page_cxxii">[Pg cxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>To Donato di Prato Vecchio, master of grammar at Venice, he leaves all
the money that he had lent him. He bequeathes the horses he may have at
his death to Bonzanello di Vigoncia and Lombardo da Serigo, two friends
of his, citizens of Padua, wishing them to draw lots for the choice of
the horses. He avows being indebted to Lombardo da Serigo 134 golden
ducats, advanced for the expenses of his house. He also bequeathes to
the same person a goblet of silver gilt (undoubtedly the same which the
Emperor Charles had sent him in 1362). He leaves to John Abucheta,
warden of his church, his great breviary, which he bought at Venice for
100 francs, on condition that, after his death, this breviary shall
remain in the sacristy for the use of the future priests of the church.
To John Boccaccio he bequeathes 50 gold florins of Florence, to buy him
a winter-habit for his studies at night. "I am ashamed," he adds, "to
leave so small a sum to so great a man;" but he entreats his friends in
general to impute the smallness of their legacies to that of his
fortune. To Tomaso Bambasi, of Ferrara, he makes a present of his good
lute, that he may make use of it in singing the praises of God. To
Giovanni Dandi, physician of Padua, he leaves 50 ducats of gold, to buy
a gold ring, which he may wear in remembrance of him.</p>

<p>He appoints Francesco da Brossano, citizen of Milan, his heir, and
desires him, not only as his heir, but as his dear son, to divide into
two parts the money he should find&mdash;the one for himself, the other for
the person to whom it was assigned. "It would seem by this," says De
Sade, "that Petrarch would not mention his daughter by name in a public
will, because she was not born in marriage." Yet his shyness to name her
makes it singular that he should style Brossano his son. In case
Brossano should die before him, he appoints Lombardo da Serigo his
eventual heir. De Sade considers the appointment as a deed of trust.
With respect to his little property at Vaucluse, he leaves it to the
hospital in that diocese. His last bequest is to his brother Gherardo, a
Carthusian of Montrieux. He desires his heir to write to him immediately
after his decease, and to give him the option of a hundred florins of
gold, payable at once, or by five or ten florins every year.</p>

<p>A few days after he had made this will, he set out for Rome. The
pleasure with which he undertook the journey made him suppose that he
could support it. But when he reached Ferrara he fell down in a fit, in
which he continued thirty hours, without sense or motion; and it was
supposed that he was dead. The most violent remedies were used to
restore him to consciousness, but he says that he felt them no more than
a statue.</p>

<p>Nicholas d'Este II., the son of Obizzo, was at that time Lord of
Ferrara, a friend and admirer of Petrarch. The physicians thought him
dead, and the whole city was in grief. The news spread to Padua, Venice,
Milan, and Pavia. Crowds came from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiii" id="Page_cxxiii">[Pg cxxiii]</a></span> all parts to his burial. Ugo d'Este,
the brother of Nicholas, a young man of much merit, who had an
enthusiastic regard for Petrarch, paid him unremitting attention during
his illness. He came three or four times a day to see him, and sent
messengers incessantly to inquire how he was. Our poet acknowledged that
he owed his life to the kindness of those two noblemen.</p>

<p>When Petrarch was recovering, he was impatient to pursue his route,
though the physicians assured him that he could not get to Rome alive.
He would have attempted the journey in spite of their warnings, if his
strength had seconded his desires, but he was unable to sit his horse.
They brought him back to Padua, laid on a soft seat on a boat. His
unhoped-for return caused as much surprise as joy in that city, where he
was received by its lords and citizens with as much joy as if he had
come back from the other world. To re-establish his health, he went to a
village called Arqu&agrave;, situated on the slope of a hill famous for the
salubrity of its air, the goodness of its wines, and the beauty of its
vineyards. An everlasting spring reigns there, and the place commands a
view of pleasingly-scattered villas. Petrarch built himself a house on
the high ground of the village, and he added to the vines of the country
a great number of other fruit-trees.</p>

<p>He had scarcely fixed himself at Arqu&agrave;, when he put his last hand to a
work which he had begun in the year 1367. To explain the subject of this
work, and the circumstances which gave rise to it, I think it necessary
to state what was the real cause of our poet's disgust at Venice. He
appeared there, no doubt, to lead an agreeable life among many friends,
whose society was delightful to him. But there reigned in this city what
Petrarch thought licentiousness in conversation. The most ignorant
persons were in the habit of undervaluing the finest geniuses. It fills
one with regret to find Petrarch impatient of a liberty of speech,
which, whatever its abuses may be, cannot be suppressed, without
crushing the liberty of human thought. At Venice, moreover, the
philosophy of Aristotle was much in vogue, if doctrines could be called
Aristotelian, which had been disfigured by commentators, and still worse
garbled by Averroes. The disciples of Averroes at Venice insisted on the
world having been co-eternal with God, and made a joke of Moses and his
book of Genesis. "Would the eternal architect," they said, "remain from
all eternity doing nothing? Certainly not! The world's youthful
appearance is owing to its revolutions, and the changes it has undergone
by deluges and conflagrations." "Those free-thinkers," Petrarch tells
us, "had a great contempt for Christ and his Apostles, as well as for
all those who did not bow the knee to the Stagirite." They called the
doctrines of Christianity fables, and hell and heaven the tales of
asses. Finally, they believed that Providence takes no care of anything
under the region of the moon. Four young Venetians of this sect had
attached themselves to Petrarch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiv" id="Page_cxxiv">[Pg cxxiv]</a></span> who endured their society, but opposed
their opinions. His opposition offended them, and they resolved to
humble him in the public estimation. They constituted themselves a
tribunal to try his merits: they appointed an advocate to plead for him,
and they concluded by determining that he was a good man, but
illiterate!</p>

<p>This affair made a great stir at Venice. Petrarch seems at first to have
smiled with sensible contempt at so impertinent a farce; but will it be
believed that his friends, and among them Donato and Boccaccio, advised
and persuaded him to treat it seriously, and to write a book about it?
Petrarch accordingly put his pen to the subject. He wrote a treatise,
which he entitled "De sui ipsius et aliorum Ignorantia&mdash;" (On his own
Ignorance, and on that of others).</p>

<p>Petrarch had himself formed the design of confuting the doctrines of
Averroes; but he engaged Ludovico Marsili, an Augustine monk of
Florence, to perform the task. This monk, in Petrarch's opinion,
possessed great natural powers, and our poet exhorts him to write
against that rabid animal (Averroes) who barks with so much fury against
Christ and his Apostles. Unfortunately, the rabid animals who write
against the truths we are most willing to believe are difficult to be
killed.</p>

<p>The good air of the Euganean mountains failed to re-establish the health
of Petrarch. He continued ill during the summer of 1370. John di Dondi,
his physician, or rather his friend, for he would have no physician,
would not quit Padua without going to see him. He wrote to him
afterwards that he had discovered the true cause of his disease, and
that it arose from his eating fruits, drinking water, and frequent
fastings. His medical adviser, also, besought him to abstain from all
salted meats, and raw fruits, or herbs. Petrarch easily renounced salted
provisions, "but, as to fruits," he says, "Nature must have been a very
unnatural mother to give us such agreeable food, with such delightful
hues and fragrance, only to seduce her children with poison covered over
with honey."</p>

<p>Whilst Petrarch was thus ill, he received news very unlikely to forward
his recovery. The Pope took a sudden resolution to return to Avignon.
That city, in concert with the Queen of Naples and the Kings of France
and Arragon, sent him vessels to convey him to Avignon. Urban gave as a
reason for his conduct the necessity of making peace between the crowns
of France and England, but no one doubted that the love of his own
country, the difficulty of inuring himself to the climate of Rome, the
enmity and rebellious character of the Italians, and the importunities
of his Cardinals, were the true cause of his return. He was received
with great demonstrations of joy; but St. Bridget had told him that if
he went to Avignon he should die soon afterwards, and it so happened
that her prophecy was fulfilled, for the Pope not long after his arrival
in Provence was seized with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxv" id="Page_cxxv">[Pg cxxv]</a></span> mortal illness, and died on the 19th of
December, 1370. In the course of his pontificate, he had received two
singular honours. The Emperor of the West had performed the office of
his equerry, and the Emperor of the East abjured schism, acknowledging
him as primate of the whole Christian Church.</p>

<p>The Cardinals chose as Urban's successor a man who did honour to their
election, namely, Pietro Rogero, nephew of Clement VI., who took the
name of Gregory XI. Petrarch knew him, he had seen him at Padua in 1307,
when the Cardinal was on his way to Rome, and rejoiced at his accession.
The new Pontiff caused a letter to be written to our poet, expressing
his wish to see him, and to be of service to him.</p>

<p>In a letter written about this time to his friend Francesco Bruni, we
perceive that Petrarch is not quite so indifferent to the good things of
the world as the general tenor of his letters would lead us to imagine.
He writes:&mdash;"Were I to say that I want means to lead the life of a
canon, I should be wrong, but when I say that my single self have more
acquaintances than all the chapter put together, and, consequently, that
I am put to more expenses in the way of hospitality, then I am right.
This embarrassment increases every day, and my resources diminish. I
have made vain efforts to free myself from my difficulties. My prebend,
it is true, yields me more bread and wine than I need for my own
consumption. I can even sell some of it. But my expenses are very
considerable. I have never less than two horses, usually five or six
amanuenses. I have only three at this moment. It is because I could find
no more. Here it is easier to find a painter than an amanuensis. I have
a venerable priest, who never quits me when I am at church. Sometimes
when I count upon dining with him alone, behold, a crowd of guests will
come in. I must give them something to eat, and I must tell them amusing
stories, or else pass for being proud or avaricious.</p>

<p>"I am desirous to found a little oratory for the Virgin Mary; and shall
do so, though I should sell or pawn my books. After that I shall go to
Avignon, if my strength permits. If it does not, I shall send one of my
people to the Cardinal Cabassole, and to you, that you may attempt to
accomplish what I have often wished, but uselessly, as both you and he
well know. If the holy father wishes to stay my old age, and put me into
somewhat better circumstances, as he appears to me to wish, and as his
predecessor promised me, the thing would be very easy. Let him do as it
may please him, much, little, or nothing; I shall be always content.
Only let him not say to me as Clement VI. used to do, 'ask what you wish
for.' I cannot do so, for several reasons. In the first place, I do not
myself know exactly what would suit me. Secondly, if I were to demand
some vacant place, it might be given away before my demand reached the
feet of his Holiness. Thirdly, I might make a request that might
displease him. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvi" id="Page_cxxvi">[Pg cxxvi]</a></span> extreme kindness might pledge him to grant it; and I
should be made miserable by obtaining it.</p>

<p>"Let him give me, then, whatever he pleases, without waiting for my
petitioning for it. Would it become me, at my years, to be a solicitor
for benefices, having never been so in my youth? I trust, in this
matter, to what you may do with the Cardinal Sabina. You are the only
friends who remain to me in that country. These thirty years the
Cardinal has given me marks of his affection and good-will. I am about
to write to him a few words on the subject; and I shall refer him to
this letter, to save my repeating to him those miserable little details
with which I should not detain you, unless it seemed to be necessary."</p>

<p>A short time afterwards, Petrarch heard, with no small satisfaction, of
the conduct of Cardinal Cabassole, at Perugia. When the Cardinal came to
take leave of the Pope the evening before his departure for that city,
he said, "Holy father, permit me to recommend Petrarch to you, on
account of my love for him. He is, indeed, a man unique upon earth&mdash;a
true ph&oelig;nix." Scarcely was he gone, when the Cardinal of Boulogne,
making pleasantries on the word ph&oelig;nix, turned into ridicule both the
praises of Cabassole and him who was their object. Francesco Bruni, in
writing to Petrarch about the kindness of the one Cardinal, thought it
unnecessary to report the pleasantries of the other. But Petrarch, who
had heard of them from another quarter, relates them himself to Bruni,
and says:&mdash;"I am not astonished. This man loved me formerly, and I was
equally attached to him. At present he hates me, and I return his
hatred. Would you know the reason of this double change? It is because
he is the enemy of truth, and I am the enemy of falsehood; he dreads the
liberty which inspires me, and I detest the pride with which he is
swollen. If our fortunes were equal, and if we were together in a free
place, I should not call myself a ph&oelig;nix; for that title ill becomes
me; but he would be an owl. Such people as he imagine, on account of
riches ill-acquired, and worse employed, that they are at liberty to say
what they please."</p>

<p>In the letter which Bruni wrote to Petrarch, to apprize him of
Cabassole's departure, and of what he had said to the Pope in his
favour, he gave him notice of the promotion of twelve new cardinals,
whom Gregory had just installed, with a view to balance the domineering
authority of the others. "And I fear," he adds, "that the Pope's
obligations to satiate those new and hungry comers may retard the
effects of his good-will towards you." "Let his Holiness satiate them,"
replied Petrarch; "let him appease their thirst, which is more than the
Tagus, the Pactolus, and the ocean itself could do&mdash;I agree to it; and
let him not think of me. I am neither famished nor thirsty. I shall
content myself with their leavings, and with what the holy father may
think meet to give, if he deigns to think of me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvii" id="Page_cxxvii">[Pg cxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>Bruni was right. The Pope, beset by applications on all hands, had no
time to think of Petrarch. Bruni for a year discontinued his
correspondence. His silence vexed our poet. He wrote to Francesco,
saying, "You do not write to me, because you cannot communicate what you
would wish. You understand me ill, and you do me injustice. I desire
nothing, and I hope for nothing, but an easy death. Nothing is more
ridiculous than an old man's avarice; though nothing is more common. It
is like a voyager wishing to heap up provisions for his voyage when he
sees himself approaching the end of it. The holy father has written me a
most obliging letter: is not that sufficient for me? I have not a doubt
of his good-will towards me, but he is encompassed by people who thwart
his intentions. Would that those persons could know how much I despise
them, and how much I prefer my mediocrity to the vain grandeur which
renders them so proud!" After a tirade against his enemies in purple,
evidently some of the Cardinals, he reproaches Bruni for having dwelt so
long for lucre in the ill-smelling Avignon; he exhorts him to leave it,
and to come and end his days at Florence. He says that he does not write
to the Pope for fear of appearing to remind him of his promises. "I have
received," he adds, "his letter and Apostolic blessing; I beg you to
communicate to his Holiness, in the clearest manner, that I wish for no
more."</p>

<p>From this period Petrarch's health was never re-established. He was
languishing with wishes to repair to Perugia, and to see his dear friend
the Cardinal Cabassole. At the commencement of spring he mounted a
horse, in order to see if he could support the journey; but his weakness
was such that he could only ride a few steps. He wrote to the Cardinal
expressing his regrets, but seems to console himself by recalling to his
old friend the days they had spent together at Vaucluse, and their long
walks, in which they often strayed so far, that the servant who came to
seek for them and to announce that dinner was ready could not find them
till the evening.</p>

<p>It appears from this epistle that our poet had a general dislike to
cardinals. "You are not," he tells Cabassole, "like most of your
brethren, whose heads are turned by a bit of red cloth so far as to
forget that they are mortal men. It seems, on the contrary, as if
honours rendered you more humble, and I do not believe that you would
change your mode of thinking if they were to put a crown on your head."
The good Cardinal, whom Petrarch paints in such pleasing colours, could
not accustom himself to the climate of Italy. He had scarcely arrived
there when he fell ill, and died on the 26th of August in the same year.</p>

<p>Of all the friends whom Petrarch had had at Avignon, he had now none
left but Mattheus le Long, Archdeacon of Liege, with whom his ties of
friendship had subsisted ever since they had studied together at
Bologna. From him he received a letter on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxviii" id="Page_cxxviii">[Pg cxxviii]</a></span> the 5th of January, 1372, and
in his answer, dated the same day at Padua, he gives this picture of his
condition, and of the life which he led:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ask about my condition&mdash;it is this. I am, thanks to God,
sufficiently tranquil, and free, unless I deceive myself, from all the
passions of my youth. I enjoyed good health for a long time, but for two
years past I have become infirm. Frequently, those around me have
believed me dead, but I live still, and pretty much the same as you have
known me. I could have mounted higher; but I wished not to do so, since
every elevation is suspicious. I have acquired many friends and a good
many books: I have lost my health and many friends; I have spent some
time at Venice. At present I am at Padua, where I perform the functions
of canon. I esteem myself happy to have quitted Venice, on account of
that war which has been declared between that Republic and the Lord of
Padua. At Venice I should have been suspected: here I am caressed. I
pass the greater part of the year in the country, which I always prefer
to the town. I repose, I write, I think; so you see that my way of life
and my pleasures are the same as in my youth. Having studied so long it
is astonishing that I have learnt so little. I hate nobody, I envy
nobody. In that first season of life which is full of error and
presumption, I despised all the world except myself. In middle life, I
despised only myself. In my aged years, I despise all the world, and
myself most of all. I fear only those whom I love. I desire only a good
end. I dread a company of valets like a troop of robbers. I should have
none at all, if my age and weakness permitted me. I am fain to shut
myself up in concealment, for I cannot endure visits; it is an honour
which displeases and wears me out. Amidst the Euganean hills I have
built a small but neat mansion, where I reckon on passing quietly the
rest of my days, having always before my eyes my dead or absent friends.
To conceal nothing from you, I have been sought after by the Pope, the
Emperor, and the King of France, who have given me pressing invitations,
but I have constantly declined them, preferring my liberty to
everything."</p>

<p>In this letter, Petrarch speaks of a sharp war that had arisen between
Venice and Padua. A Gascon, named Rainier, who commanded the troops of
Venice, having thrown bridges over the Brenta, established his camp at
Abano, whence he sent detachments to ravage the lands of Padua. Petrarch
was in great alarm; for Arqu&agrave; is only two leagues from Abano. He set out
on the 15th of November for Padua, to put himself and his books under
protection. A friend at Verona wrote to him, saying, "Only write your
name over the door of your house, and fear nothing; it will be your
safeguard." The advice, it is hardly necessary to say, was absurd. Among
the pillaging soldiery there were thousands who could not have read the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxix" id="Page_cxxix">[Pg cxxix]</a></span>
poet's name if they had seen it written, and of those who were
accomplished enough to read, probably many who would have thought
Petrarch as fit to be plundered as another man. Petrarch, therefore,
sensibly replied, "I should be sorry to trust them. Mars respects not
the favourites of the Muses; I have no such idea of my name, as that it
would shelter me from the furies of war." He was even in pain about his
domestics, whom he left at Arqu&agrave;, and who joined him some days
afterwards.</p>

<p>Pandolfo Malatesta, learning what was passing in the Paduan territory,
and the danger to which Petrarch was exposed, sent to offer him his
horses, and an escort to conduct him to Pesaro, which was at that time
his residence. He was Lord of Pesaro and Fossombrone. The envoy of
Pandolfo found our poet at Padua, and used every argument to second his
Lord's invitation; but Petrarch excused himself on account of the state
of his health, the insecurity of the highways, and the severity of the
weather. Besides, he said that it would be disgraceful to him to leave
Padua in the present circumstances, and that it would expose him to the
suspicion of cowardice, which he never deserved.</p>

<p>Pandolfo earnestly solicited from Petrarch a copy of his Italian works.
Our poet in answer says to him, "I have sent to you by your messenger
these trifles which were the amusement of my youth. They have need of
all your indulgence. It is shameful for an old man to send you things of
this nature; but you have earnestly asked for them, and can I refuse you
anything? With what grace could I deny you verses which are current in
the streets, and are in the mouth of all the world, who prefer them to
the more solid compositions that I have produced in my riper years?"
This letter is dated at Padua, on the 4th of January, 1373. Pandolfo
Malatesta died a short time after receiving it.</p>

<p>Several Powers interfered to mediate peace between Venice and Padua, but
their negotiations ended in nothing, the spirits of both belligerents
were so embittered. The Pope had sent as his nuncio for this purpose a
young professor of law, named Uguzzone da Thiene, who was acquainted
with Petrarch. He lodged with our poet when he came to Padua, and he
communicated to him some critical remarks which had been written at
Avignon on Petrarch's letter to Pope Urban V., congratulating him on his
return to Rome. A French monk of the order of St. Bernard passed for the
author of this work. As it spoke irreverently of Italy, it stirred up
the bile of Petrarch, and made him resume the pen with his sickly hand.
His answer to the offensive production flows with anger, and is harsh
even to abusiveness. He declaims, as usual, in favour of Italy, which he
adored, and against France, which he disliked.</p>

<p>After a suspension the war was again conducted with fury, till at last a
peace was signed at Venice on the 11th of September,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxx" id="Page_cxxx">[Pg cxxx]</a></span> 1373. The
conditions were hard and humiliating to the chief of Padua. The third
article ordained that he should come in person, or send his son, to ask
pardon of the Venetian Republic for the insults he had offered her, and
swear inviolable fidelity to her. The Carrara sent his son Francesco
Novello, and requested Petrarch to accompany him. Our poet had no great
wish to do so, and had too good an excuse in the state of his health,
which was still very fluctuating, but the Prince importuned him, and he
thought that he could not refuse a favour to such a friend.</p>

<p>Francesco Novello, accompanied by Petrarch, and by a great suite of
Paduan gentlemen, arrived at Venice on the 27th of September, where they
were well received, especially the poet. On the following day the chiefs
of the maiden city gave him a public audience. But, whether the majesty
of the Venetian Senate affected Petrarch, or his illness returned by
accident, so it was that he could not deliver the speech which he had
prepared, for his memory failed him. But the universal desire to hear
him induced the Senators to postpone their sitting to the following day.
He then spoke with energy, and was extremely applauded. Franceso Novello
begged pardon, and took the oath of fidelity.</p>

<p>Francesco da Carrara loved and revered Petrarch, and used to go
frequently to see him without ceremony in his small mansion at Arqu&agrave;.
The Prince one day complained to him that he had written for all the
world excepting himself. Petrarch thought long and seriously about what
he should compose that might please the Carrara; but the task was
embarrassing. To praise him directly might seem sycophantish and fulsome
to the Prince himself. To censure him would be still more indelicate. To
escape the difficulty, he projected a treatise on the best mode of
governing a State, and on the qualities required in the person who has
such a charge. This subject furnished occasion for giving indirect
praises, and, at the same time, for pointing out some defects which he
had remarked in his patron's government.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that there are some excellent maxims respecting
government in this treatise, and that it was a laudable work for the
fourteenth century. But since that period the subject has been so often
discussed by minds of the first order, that we should look in vain into
Petrarch's Essay for any truths that have escaped their observation.
Nature offers herself in virgin beauty to the primitive poet. But
abstract truth comes not to the philosopher, till she has been tried by
the test of time.</p>

<p>After his return from Venice, Petrarch only languished. A low fever,
that undermined his constitution, left him but short intervals of
health, but made no change in his mode of life; he passed the greater
part of the day in reading or writing. It does not appear, however, that
he composed any work in the course of the year 1374. A few letters to
Boccaccio are all that can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxi" id="Page_cxxxi">[Pg cxxxi]</a></span> traced to his pen during that period.
Their date is not marked in them, but they were certainly written
shortly before his death. None of them possess any particular interest,
excepting that always in which he mentions the Decameron.</p>

<p>It seems at first sight not a little astonishing that Petrarch, who had
been on terms of the strictest friendship with Boccaccio for twenty-four
years, should never till now have read his best work. Why did not
Boccaccio send him his Decameron long before? The solution of this
question must be made by ascribing the circumstance to the author's
sensitive respect for the austerely moral character of our poet.</p>

<p>It is not known by what accident the Decameron fell into Petrarch's
hands, during the heat of the war between Venice and Padua. Even then
his occupations did not permit him to peruse it thoroughly; he only
slightly ran through it, after which he says in his letter to Boccaccio,
"I have not read your book with sufficient attention to pronounce an
opinion upon it; but it has given me great pleasure. That which is too
free in the work is sufficiently excusable for the age at which you
wrote it, for its elegant language, for the levity of the subject, for
the class of readers to whom it is suited. Besides, in the midst of much
gay and playful matter, several grave and pious thoughts are to be
found. Like the rest of the world, I have been particularly struck by
the beginning and the end. The description which you give of the state
of our country during the plague, appeared to me most true and most
pathetic. The story which forms the conclusion made so vivid an
impression on me, that I wished to get it by heart, in order to repeat
it to some of my friends."</p>

<p>Petrarch, perceiving that this touching story of Griseldis made an
impression on all the world, had an idea of translating it into Latin,
for those who knew not the vulgar tongue. The following anecdote
respecting it is told by Petrarch himself:&mdash;"One of his friends, a man
of knowledge and intellect, undertook to read it to a company; but he
had hardly got into the midst of it, when his tears would not permit him
to continue. Again he tried to resume the reading, but with no better
success."</p>

<p>Another friend from Verona having heard what had befallen the Paduan,
wished to try the same experiment; he took up the composition, and read
it aloud from beginning to end without the smallest change of voice or
countenance, and said, in returning the book, "It must be owned that
this is a touching story, and I should have wept, also, if I believed it
to be true; but it is clearly a fable. There never was and there never
will be such a woman as Griseldis."<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>This letter, which Petrarch sent to Boccaccio, accompanied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxii" id="Page_cxxxii">[Pg cxxxii]</a></span> a Latin
translation of his story, is dated, in a MS. of the French King's
library, the 8th of June, 1374. It is perhaps, the last letter which he
ever wrote. He complains in it of "mischievous people, who opened
packets to read the letters contained in them, and copied what they
pleased. Proceeding in their licence, they even spared themselves the
trouble of transcription, and kept the packets themselves." Petrarch,
indignant at those violators of the rights and confidence of society,
took the resolution of writing no more, and bade adieu to his friends
and epistolary correspondence, "Valete amici, valete epistol&aelig;."</p>

<p>Petrarch died a very short time after despatching this letter. His
biographers and contemporary authors are not agreed as to the day of his
demise, but the probability seems to be that it was the 18th of July.
Many writers of his life tell us that he expired in the arms of Lombardo
da Serigo, whom Philip Villani and Gianozzo Manetti make their authority
for an absurd tradition connected with his death. They pretend that when
he breathed his last several persons saw a white cloud, like the smoke
of incense, rise to the roof of his chamber, where it stopped for some
time and then vanished, a miracle, they add, clearly proving that his
soul was acceptable to God, and ascended to heaven. Giovanni Manzini
gives a different account. He says that Petrarch's people found him in
his library, sitting with his head reclining on a book. Having often
seen him in this attitude, they were not alarmed at first; but, soon
finding that he exhibited no signs of life, they gave way to their
sorrow. According to Domenico Aretino, who was much attached to
Petrarch, and was at that time at Padua, so that he may be regarded as
good authority, his death was occasioned by apoplexy.</p>

<p>The news of his decease made a deep impression throughout Italy; and, in
the first instance, at Arqu&agrave; and Padua, and in the cities of the
Euganean hills. Their people hastened in crowds to pay their last duties
to the man who had honoured their country by his residence. Francesco da
Carrara repaired to Arqu&agrave; with all his nobility to assist at his
obsequies. The Bishop went thither with his chapter and with all his
clergy, and the common people flocked together to share in the general
mourning.</p>

<p>The body of Petrarch, clad in red satin, which was the dress of the
canons of Padua, supported by sixteen doctors on a bier covered with
cloth of gold bordered with ermine, was carried to the parish church of
Arqu&agrave;, which was fitted up in a manner suitable to the ceremony. After
the funeral oration had been pronounced by Bonaventura da Praga, of the
order of the hermits of St. Augustin, the corpse was interred in a
chapel which Petrarch himself had erected in the parish church in honour
of the Virgin. A short time afterwards, Francesco Brossano, having
caused a tomb of marble to be raised on four pillars opposite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiii" id="Page_cxxxiii">[Pg cxxxiii]</a></span> to the
same church, transferred the body to that spot, and engraved over it an
epitaph in some bad Latin lines, the rhyming of which is their greatest
merit. In the year 1637, Paul Valdezucchi, proprietor of the house and
grounds of Petrarch at Arqu&agrave;, caused a bust of bronze to be placed above
his mausoleum.</p>

<p>In the year 1630, his monument was violated by some sacrilegious
thieves, who carried off some of his bones for the sake of selling them.
The Senate of Venice severely punished the delinquents, and by their
decree upon the subject testified their deep respect for the remains of
this great man.</p>

<p>The moment the poet's will was opened, Brossano, his heir, hastened to
forward to his friends the little legacies which had been left them;
among the rest his fifty florins to Boccaccio. The answer of that most
interesting man is characteristic of his sensibility, whilst it
unhappily shows him to be approaching the close of his life (for he
survived Petrarch but a year), in pain and extreme debility. "My first
impulse," he says to Brossano, "on hearing of the decease of my master,"
so he always denominated our poet, "was to have hastened to his tomb to
bid him my last adieu, and to mix my tears with yours. But ever since I
lectured in public on the Divina Commedia of Dante, which is now ten
months, I have suffered under a malady which has so weakened and changed
me, that you would not recognise me. I have totally lost the stoutness
and complexion which I had when you saw me at Venice. My leanness is
extreme, my sight is dim, my hands shake, and my knees totter, so that I
can hardly drag myself to my country-house at Certaldo, where I only
languish. After reading your letter, I wept a whole night for my dear
master, not on his own account, for his piety permits us not to doubt
that he is now happy, but for myself and for his friends whom he has
left in this world, like a vessel in a stormy sea without a pilot. By my
own grief I judge of yours, and of that of Tullia, my beloved sister,
your worthy spouse. I envy Arqu&agrave; the happiness of holding deposited in
her soil him whose heart was the abode of the Muses, and the sanctuary
of philosophy and eloquence. That village, scarcely known to Padua, will
henceforth be famed throughout the world. Men will respect it like Mount
Pausilippo for containing the ashes of Virgil, the shore of the Euxine
for possessing the tomb of Ovid, and Smyrna for its being believed to be
the burial-place of Homer." Among other things, Boccaccio inquires what
has become of his divine poem entitled Africa, and whether it had been
committed to the flames, a fate with which Petrarch, from excess of
delicacy, often threatened his compositions.</p>

<p>From this letter it appears that this epic, to which he owed the laurel
and no small part of his living reputation, had not yet been published,
with the exception of thirty-four verses, which had appeared at Naples
through the indiscretion of Barbatus. Boccaccio said that Petrarch kept
it continually locked up, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiv" id="Page_cxxxiv">[Pg cxxxiv]</a></span> had been several times inclined to burn
it. The author of the Decameron himself did not long survive his master:
he died the 21st of December, 1375.</p>

<p>Petrarch so far succeeded in clearing the road to the study of
antiquities, as to deserve the title which he justly retains of the
restorer of classical learning; nor did his enthusiasm for ancient
monuments prevent him from describing them with critical taste. He gave
an impulse to the study of geography by his Itinerarium Syriacum. That
science had been partially revived in the preceding century, by the
publication of Marco Polo's travels, and journeys to distant countries
had been accomplished more frequently than before, not only by religious
missionaries, but by pilgrims who travelled from purely rational
curiosity: but both of these classes of travellers, especially the
religionists, dealt profusely in the marvellous; and their falsehoods
were further exaggerated by copyists, who wished to profit by the sale
of MSS. describing their adventures. As an instance of the doubtful
wonders related by wayfaring men, may be noticed what is told of
Octorico da Pordenone, who met, at Trebizond, with a man who had trained
four thousand partridges to follow him on journeys for three days
together, who gathered around like chickens when he slept, and who
returned home after he had sold to the Emperor as many of them as his
imperial majesty chose to select.</p>

<p>His treatise, "De Remediis utriusque Fortun&aelig;" (On the Remedies for both
Extremes of Fortune) was one of his great undertakings in the solitude
of Vaucluse, though it was not finished till many years afterwards, when
it was dedicated to Azzo Correggio. Here he borrows, of course, largely
from the ancients; at the same time he treats us to some observations on
human nature sufficiently original to keep his work from the dryness of
plagiarism.</p>

<p>His treatise on "A Solitary Life" was written as an apology for his own
love of retirement&mdash;retirement, not solitude, for Petrarch had the
social feeling too strongly in his nature to desire a perfect hermitage.
He loved to have a friend now and then beside him, to whom he might say
how sweet is solitude. Even his deepest retirement in the "shut-up
valley" was occasionally visited by dear friends, with whom his
discourse was so interesting that they wandered in the woods so long and
so far, that the servant could not find them to announce that their
dinner was ready. In his rapturous praise of living alone, our poet,
therefore, says more than he sincerely meant; he liked retirement, to be
sure, but then it was with somebody within reach of him, like the young
lady in Miss Porter's novel, who was fond of solitude, and walked much
in Hyde Park by herself, with her footman behind her.</p>

<p>His treatise, "De Otio Religiosorum," was written in 1353, after an
agreeable visit to his brother, who was a monk. It is a commendation of
the monastic life. He may be found, I dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxv" id="Page_cxxxv">[Pg cxxxv]</a></span> say, to exaggerate the
blessing of that mode of life which, in proportion to our increasing
activity and intelligence, has sunk in the estimation of Protestant
society, so that we compare the whole monkish fraternity with the drones
in a hive, an ignavum pecus, whom the other bees are right in expelling.</p>

<p>Though I shall never pretend to be the translator of Petrarch, I recoil
not, after writing his Life, from giving a sincere account of the
impression which his poetry produces on my mind. I have studied the
Italian language with assiduity, though perhaps at a later period of my
life than enables the ear to be <i>perfectly</i> sensitive to its harmony,
for it is in youth, nay, almost in childhood alone, that the melody and
felicitous expressions of any tongue can touch our deepest sensibility;
but still I have studied it with pains&mdash;I believe I can thoroughly
appreciate Dante; I can perceive much in Petrarch that is elevated and
tender; and I approach the subject unconscious of the slightest
splenetic prejudice.</p>

<p>I demur to calling him the first of modern poets who refined and
dignified the language of love. Dante had certainly set him the example.
It is true that, compared with his brothers of classical antiquity in
love-poetry, he appears like an Abel of purity offering innocent incense
at the side of so many Cains making their carnal sacrifices. Tibullus
alone anticipates his tenderness. At the same time, while Petrarch is
purer than those classical lovers, he is never so natural as they
sometimes are when their passages are least objectionable, and the
sun-bursts of his real, manly, and natural human love seem to me often
to come to us straggling through the clouds of Platonism.</p>

<p>I will not expatiate on the <i>concetti</i> that may be objected to in many
of his sonnets, for they are so often in such close connection with
exquisitely fine thoughts, that, in tearing away the weed, we might be
in danger of snapping the flower.</p>

<p>I feel little inclined, besides, to dwell on Petrarch's faults with that
feline dilation of vision which sees in the dark what would escape other
eyes in daylight, for, if I could make out the strongest critical case
against him, I should still have to answer this question, "How comes it
that Petrarch's poetry, in spite of all these faults, has been the
favourite of the world for nearly five hundred years?"</p>

<p>So strong a regard for Petrarch is rooted in the mind of Italy, that his
renown has grown up like an oak which has reached maturity amidst the
storms of ages, and fears not decay from revolving centuries. One of the
high charms of his poetical language is its pure and melting melody, a
charm untransferable to any more northern tongue.</p>

<p>No conformation of words will charm the ear unless they bring silent
thoughts of corresponding sweetness to the mind; nor could the most
sonorous, vapid verses be changed into poetry if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvi" id="Page_cxxxvi">[Pg cxxxvi]</a></span> they were set to the
music of the Spheres. It is scarcely necessary to say that Petrarch has
intellectual graces of thought and spiritual felicities of diction,
without which his tactics in the mere march of words would be a
worthless skill.</p>

<p>The love of Petrarch was misplaced, but its utterance was at once so
fervid and delicate, and its enthusiasm so enduring, that the purest
minds feel justified in abstracting from their consideration the
unhappiness of the attachment, and attending only to its devout
fidelity. Among his deepest admirers we shall find women of virtue above
suspicion, who are willing to forget his Laura being married, or to
forgive the circumstance for the eloquence of his courtship and the
unwavering faith of his affection. Nor is this predilection for Petrarch
the result of female vanity and the mere love of homage. No; it is a
wise instinctive consciousness in women that the offer of love to them,
without enthusiasm, refinement, and <i>constancy</i>, is of no value at all.
Without these qualities in their wooers, they are the slaves of the
stronger sex. It is no wonder, therefore, that they are grateful to
Petrarch for holding up the perfect image of a lover, and that they
regard him as a friend to that passion, on the delicacy and constancy of
which the happiness, the most hallowed ties, and the very continuance of
the species depend.</p>

<p>In modern Italian criticism there are two schools of taste, whose
respective partizans may be called the Petrarchists and the Danteists.
The latter allege that Petrarch's amatory poetry, from its platonic and
mystic character, was best suited to the age of cloisters, of dreaming
voluptuaries, and of men living under tyrannical Governments, whose
thoughts and feelings were oppressed and disguised. The genius of Dante,
on the other hand, they say, appeals to all that is bold and natural in
the human breast, and they trace the grand revival of his popularity in
our own times to the re-awakened spirit of liberty. On this side of the
question the most eminent Italian scholars and poets are certainly
ranged. The most gifted man of that country with whom I was ever
personally acquainted, Ugo Foscolo, was a vehement Danteist. Yet his
copious memory was well stored with many a sonnet of Petrarch, which he
could repeat by heart; and with all his Danteism, he infused the deepest
tones of admiration into his recitation of the Petrarchan sonnets.</p>

<p>And altogether, Foscolo, though a cautious, is a candid admirer of our
poet. He says, "The harmony, elegance, and perfection of his poetry are
the result of long labour; but its original conceptions and pathos
always sprang from the sudden inspiration of a deep and powerful
passion. By an attentive perusal of all the writings of Petrarch, it may
be reduced almost to a certainty that, by dwelling perpetually on the
same ideas, and by allowing his mind to prey incessantly on itself, the
whole train of his feelings and reflections acquired one strong
character and tone, and, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvii" id="Page_cxxxvii">[Pg cxxxvii]</a></span> he was ever able to suppress them for a
time, they returned to him with increased violence; that, to
tranquillize this agitated state of his mind, he, in the first instance,
communicated in a free and loose manner all that he thought and felt, in
his correspondence with his intimate friends; that he afterwards reduced
these narratives, with more order and description, into Latin verse; and
that he, lastly, perfected them with a greater profusion of imagery and
more art in his Italian poetry, the composition of which at first served
only, as he frequently says, to divert and mitigate all his afflictions.
We may thus understand the perfect concord which prevails in Petrarch's
poetry between Nature and Art; between the accuracy of fact and the
magic of invention; between depth and perspicuity; between devouring
passion and calm meditation. It is precisely because the poetry of
Petrarch originally sprang from the heart that his passion never seems
fictitious or cold, notwithstanding the profuse ornament of his style,
or the metaphysical elevation of his thoughts."</p>

<p>I quote Ugo Foscolo, because he is not only a writer of strong poetic
feeling as well as philosophic judgment, but he is pre-eminent in that
Italian critical school who see the merits of Petrarch in no exaggerated
light, but, on the whole, prefer Dante to him as a poet. Petrarch's
love-poetry, Foscolo remarks, may be considered as the intermediate link
between that of the classics and the moderns. * * * * Petrarch both
feels like the ancient and philosophizes like the modern poets. When he
paints after the manner of the classics, he is equal to them.</p>

<p>I despair of ever seeing in English verse a translation of Petrarch's
Italian poetry that shall be adequate and popular. The term adequate, of
course, always applies to the translation of genuine poetry in a subdued
sense. It means the best that can be expected, after making allowance
for that escape of etherial spirit which is inevitable in the transfer
of poetic thoughts from one language to another. The word popular is
also to be taken in a limited meaning regarding all translations.
Cowper's ballad of John Gilpin is twenty times more popular than his
Homer; yet the latter work is deservedly popular in comparison with the
bulk of translations from antiquity. The same thing may be said of
Cary's Dante; it is, like Cowper's Homer, as adequate and popular as
translated poetry can be expected to be. Yet I doubt if either of those
poets could have succeeded so well with Petrarch. Lady Dacre has shown
much grace and ingenuity in the passages of our poet which she has
versified; but she could not transfer into English those graces of
Petrarchan diction, which are mostly intransferable. She could not bring
the Italian language along with her.</p>

<p>Is not this, it may be asked, a proof that Petrarch is not so genuine a
poet as Homer and Dante, since his charm depends upon the delicacies of
diction that evaporate in the transfer from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxviii" id="Page_cxxxviii">[Pg cxxxviii]</a></span> tongue to tongue, more than
on hardy thoughts that will take root in any language to which they are
transplanted? In a general view, I agree with this proposition; yet,
what we call felicitous diction can never have a potent charm without
refined thoughts, which, like essential odours, may be too impalpable to
bear transfusion. Burns has the happiest imaginable Scottish diction;
yet, what true Scotsman would bear to see him <i>done</i> into French? And,
with the exception of German, what language has done justice to
Shakespeare?</p>

<p>The reader must be a true Petrarchist who is unconscious of a general
similarity in the character of his sonnets, which, in the long perusal
of them, amounts to monotony. At the same time, it must be said that
this monotonous similarity impresses the mind of Petrarch's reader
exactly in proportion to the slenderness of his acquaintance with the
poet. Does he approach Petrarch's sonnets for the first time, they will
probably appear to him all as like to each other as the sheep of a
flock; but, when he becomes more familiar with them, he will perceive an
interesting individuality in every sonnet, and will discriminate their
individual character as precisely as the shepherd can distinguish every
single sheep of his flock by its voice and face. It would be rather
tedious to pull out, one by one, all the sheep and lambs of our poet's
flock of sonnets, and to enumerate the varieties of their bleat; and
though, by studying the subject half his lifetime, a man might classify
them by their main characteristics, he would find they defy a perfect
classification, as they often blend different qualities. Some of them
have a uniform expression of calm and beautiful feeling. Others breathe
ardent and almost hopeful passion. Others again show him jealous,
despondent, despairing; sometimes gloomily, and sometimes with touching
resignation. But a great many of them have a mixed character, where, in
the space of a line, he passes from one mood of mind to another.</p>

<p>As an example of pleasing and calm reflection, I would cite the first of
his sonnets, according to the order in which they are usually printed.
It is singular to find it confessing the poet's shame at the retrospect
of so many years spent.</p>

<p>The following sonnet (cxxvi.) is such a gem of Petrarchan and Platonic
homage to beauty that I subjoin my translation of it with the most
sincere avowal of my conscious inability to do it justice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In what ideal world or part of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Nature find the model of that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And form, so fraught with loveliness and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which, to our creation, she has given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her prime proof of creative power above?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fountain nymph or goddess ever let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such lovely tresses float of gold refined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the breeze, or in a single mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where have so many virtues ever met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en though those charms have slain my bosom's weal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows not love who has not seen her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn when she sweetly speaks, or smiles, or sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or how the power of love can hurt or heal.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sonnet lxix. is remarkable for the fineness of its closing thought.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Time was her tresses by the breathing air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wreathed to many a ringlet golden bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was her eyes diffused unmeasured light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now their lovely beams are waxing rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face methought that in its blushes show'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassion, her angelic shape and walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice that seem'd with Heaven's own speech to talk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At these, what wonder that my bosom glow'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living sun she seem'd&mdash;a spirit of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those charms decline: but does my passion? No!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love not less&mdash;the slackening of the bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assuages not the wound its shaft has given.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following sonnet is remarkable for its last four lines having
puzzled all the poet's commentators to explain what he meant by the
words "Al man ond' io scrivo &egrave; fatta arnica, a questo volta." I agree
with De Sade in conjecturing that Laura in receiving some of his verses
had touched the hand that presented them, in token of her gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In solitudes I've ever loved to abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By woods and streams, and shunn'd the evil-hearted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from the path of heaven are foully parted;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Tuscany has been to me denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sunny realms I would have gladly haunted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still the Sorgue his beauteous hills among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has lent auxiliar murmurs to my song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echoed to the plaints my love has chanted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here triumph'd, too, the poet's hand that wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These lines&mdash;the power of love has witness'd this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious victory! I know my bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knows it too&mdash;the saint on whom I dote.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Petrarch's poetry that is not amatory, Ugo Foscolo says with justice,
that his three political canzoni, exquisite as they are in versification
and style, do not breathe that enthusiasm which opened to Pindar's grasp
all the wealth of imagination, all the treasures of historic lore and
moral truth, to illustrate and dignify his strain. Yet the vigour, the
arrangement, and the perspicuity of the ideas in these canzoni of
Petrarch, the tone of conviction and melancholy in which the patriot
upbraids and mourns over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxl" id="Page_cxl">[Pg cxl]</a></span> his country, strike the heart with such force,
as to atone for the absence of grand and exuberant imagery, and of the
irresistible impetus which peculiarly belongs to the ode.</p>

<p>Petrarch's principal Italian poem that is not thrown into the shape of
the sonnet is his Trionfi, or Triumphs, in five parts. Though not
consisting of sonnets, however, it has the same amatory and constant
allusions to Laura as the greater part of his poetry. Here, as
elsewhere, he recurs from time to time to the history of his passion,
its rise, its progress, and its end. For this purpose, he describes
human life in its successive stages, omitting no opportunity of
introducing his mistress and himself.</p>

<p>1. Man in his youthful state is the slave of love. 2. As he advances in
age, he feels the inconveniences of his amatory propensities, and
endeavours to conquer them by chastity. 3. Amidst the victory which he
obtains over himself, Death steps in, and levels alike the victor and
the vanquished. 4. But Fame arrives after death, and makes man as it
were live again after death, and survive it for ages by his fame. 5. But
man even by fame cannot live for ever, if God has not granted him a
happy existence throughout eternity. Thus Love triumphs over Man;
Chastity triumphs over Love; Death triumphs over both; Fame triumphs
over Death; Time triumphs over Fame; and Eternity triumphs over Time.</p>

<p>The subordinate parts and imagery of the Trionfi have a beauty rather
arabesque than classical, and resembling the florid tracery of the later
oriental Gothic architecture. But the whole effect of the poem is
pleasing, from the general grandeur of its design.</p>

<p>In summing up Petrarch's character, moral, political, and poetical, I
should not stint myself to the equivocal phrase used by Tacitus
respecting Agricola: <i>Bonum virum facile dixeris, magnum libenter</i>, but
should at once claim for his memory the title both of great and good. A
restorer of ancient learning, a rescuer of its treasures from oblivion,
a despiser of many contemporary superstitions, a man, who, though no
reformer himself, certainly contributed to the Reformation, an Italian
patriot who was above provincial partialities, a poet who still lives in
the hearts of his country, and who is shielded from oblivion by more
generations than there were hides in the sevenfold shield of Ajax&mdash;if
this was not a great man, many who are so called must bear the title
unworthily. He was a faithful friend, and a devoted lover, and appears
to have been one of the most fascinating beings that ever existed. Even
when his failings were admitted, it must still be said that <i>even his
failings leaned to virtue's side</i>, and, altogether we may pronounce that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His life was gentle, and the elements<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I said, as far from men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How came I here, and when?"<br /></span>

<h3><i>Nel tempo che rinova i miei sospiri.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the time when I do sadly pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sighs, in tribute to that sweet-sour day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which first gave being to my tedious woes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun now o'er the Bull's horns proudly goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pha&euml;ton had renew'd his wonted race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Love, the season, and my own ill case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew me that solitary place to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which I oft unload my charg&egrave;d mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, tired with raving thoughts and helpless moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep seal'd my eyes up, and, my senses gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My waking fancy spied a shining light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which appear'd long pain, and short delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty General I then did see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one, who, for some glorious victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should to the Capitol in triumph go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I (who had not been used to such a show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this soft age, where we no valour have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pride) admired his habit, strange and brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And having raised mine eyes, which wearied were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To understand this sight was all my care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four snowy steeds a fiery chariot drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sat the cruel boy; a threatening yew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right hand bore, his quiver arrows held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against whose force no helm or shield prevail'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two party-colour'd wings his shoulders ware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All naked else; and round about his chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were thousand mortals: some in battle ta'en,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many were hurt with darts, and many slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad to learn news, I rose, and forward press'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far, that I was one amongst the rest;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span><span class="i0">As if I had been kill'd with loving pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my time; and looking through the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this tear-thirsty king, I would have spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of my old acquaintance, but descried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No face I knew: if any such there were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were transform'd with prison, death, and care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last one ghost, less sad than th' others, came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, near approaching, call'd me by my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "This comes of Love." "What may you be,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I answer'd, wondering much, "that thus know me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I remember not t' have seen your face."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thus replied: "It is the dusky place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dulls thy sight, and this hard yoke I bear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else I a Tuscan am; thy friend, and dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy remembrance." His wonted phrase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And voice did then discover what he was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we retired aside, and left the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus he spake: "I have expected long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see you here with us; your face did seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To threaten you no less. I do esteem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your prophesies; but I have seen what care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attends a lover's life; and must beware."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet have I oft been beaten in the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes hurt," said I, "but scorn'd to yield."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smiled and said: "Alas! thou dost not see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son, how great a flame's prepared for thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew not then what by his words he meant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since I find it by the dire event;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my memory 'tis fix'd so fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That marble gravings cannot firmer last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile my forward youth did thus inquire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What may these people be? I much desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know their names; pray, give me leave to ask."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I think ere long 'twill be a needless task,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied my friend; "thou shalt be of the train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know them all; this captivating chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy neck must bear, (though thou dost little fear,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sooner change thy comely form and hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than be unfetter'd from the cruel tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howe'er thou struggle for thy liberty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to fulfil thy wish, I will relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I have learn'd. The first that keeps such state,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span><span class="i0">By whom our lives and freedoms we forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world hath call'd him Love; and he (you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shall know better when he comes to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lord to you, as now he is to me)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in his childhood mild, fierce in his age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis best believed of those that feel his rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth of this thou in thyself shalt find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I warn thee now, pray keep it in thy mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of idle looseness he is oft the child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasant fancies nourish'd, and is styled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or made a god by vain and foolish men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a recompense, some meet their bane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others, a harder slavery must endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than many thousand chains and bolts procure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other gallant lord is conqueror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of conquering Rome, led captive by the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Egyptian queen, with her persuasive art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in his honours claims the greatest part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For binding the world's victor with her charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trophies are all hers by right of arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next is his adoptive son, whose love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May seem more just, but doth no better prove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though he did his lov&egrave;d Livia wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was seduc&egrave;d from her husband's bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nero is third, disdainful, wicked, fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet a woman found a way to pierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His angry soul. Behold, Marcus, the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise emperor, is fair Faustina's slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These two are tyrants: Dionysius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Alexander, both suspicious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet both loved: the last a just reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found of his causeless fear. I know y' have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, who for Cre&uuml;sa on the rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antandrus mourn'd so long; whose warlike stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once revenged his friend and won his love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the youth whom Ph&aelig;dra could not move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T' abuse his father's bed; he left the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his virtue lost his life (for base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unworthy loves to rage do quickly change).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It kill'd her too; perhaps in just revenge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrong'd Theseus, slain Hippolytus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poor forsaken Ariadne: thus<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span><span class="i0">It often proves that they who falsely blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, in one breath themselves condemn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who have guilty been of treachery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Need not complain, if they deceiv&egrave;d be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the brave hero a captive made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all his fame, and twixt these sisters led:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as he joy'd the death of th' one to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His death did ease the other's misery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next that followeth, though the world admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength, Love bound him. Th' other full of ire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is great Achilles, he whose pitied fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was caused by Love. Demophoon did not hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient Phyllis, yet procured her death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Jason is, he whom Medea hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obliged by mischief; she to her father proved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False, to her brother cruel; t' him she loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew furious, by her merit over-prized.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hypsipyle comes next, mournful, despised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounded to see a stranger's love prevail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than her own, a Greek. Here is the frail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Helena, with her the shepherd boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose gazing looks hurt Greece, and ruin'd Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mongst other weeping souls, you hear the moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&OElig;none makes, her Paris being gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Menelaus, for the woe he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose his wife. Hermione is sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls her dear Orestes to her aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Laodamia, that hapless maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewails Protesilaus. Argia proved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Polynice more faithful than the loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(But false and covetous) Amphiaraus' wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groans and sighs of those who lose their life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this kind lord, in unrelenting flames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hear: I cannot tell you half their names.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they appear not only men that love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods themselves do fill this myrtle grove:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see fair Venus caught by Vulcan's art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With angry Mars; Proserpina apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pluto, jealous Juno, yellow-hair'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo, who the young god's courage dared:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of his trophies proud, laugh'd at the bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in Thessalia gave him such a blow.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span><span class="i0">What shall I say?&mdash;here, in a word, are all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods that Varro mentions, great and small;<br /></span>

<h4>PART II.</h4>

<h3><i>Stanci gi&agrave; di mirar, non sazio ancora.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Wearied</span>, not satisfied, with much delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now here, now there, I turn'd my greedy sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many things I view'd: to write were long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time is short, great store of passions throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within my breast; when lo, a lovely pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join'd hand in hand, who kindly talking were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew my attention that way: their attire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And foreign language quicken'd my desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of further knowledge, which I soon might gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My kind interpreter did all explain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When both I knew, I boldly then drew near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved our country, though she made it fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Masinissa! I adjure thee by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Scipio, and her who from thine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew manly tears," said I; "let it not be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trouble, what I must demand of thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He look'd, and said: "I first desire to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your name and quality; for well you show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y' have heard the combat in my wounded soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Love did Friendship, Friendship Love control."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am not worth your knowledge, my poor flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives little light," said I: "your royal fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sets hearts on fire, that never see your face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, pray you, say; are you two led in peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him?"&mdash;(I show'd their guide)&mdash;"Your history<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves record: it seemeth strange to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That faith and cruelty should come so near."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said: "Thine own expressions witness bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st enough, yet I will all relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee; 't will somewhat ease my heavy state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that brave man my heart was fix'd so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That L&aelig;lius' love to him could be but such;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er his colours march&egrave;d, I was nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fortune did attend with victory:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet still his merit call'd for more than she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could give, or any else deserve but he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the West the Roman eagles came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself was also there, and caught a flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purer never burnt in lover's breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such a joy could not be long possess'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our nuptial knot, alas! he soon untied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had more power than all the world beside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cared not for our sighs; and though 't be true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he divided us, his worth I knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must be blind that cannot see the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by strict justice Love is quite undone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counsel from such a friend gave such a stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love, it almost split, as on a rock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as my father I his wrath did fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a son he in my love was dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers in age we were, him I obey'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with a troubled soul and look dismay'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus my dear half had an untimely death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She prized her freedom far above her breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I th' unhappy instrument was made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such force th' intreaty and intreater had!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rather chose myself than him t' offend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent the poison brought her to her end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what sad thoughts I know, and she'll confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, if you have sense of love, may guess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No heir she left me, but my tedious moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though in her my hopes and joys were gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was of lower value than my faith!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now farewell, and try if this troop hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another wonder; for the time is less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than is the task." I pitied their distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose short joy ended in so sharp a woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soft heart melted. As they onward go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This youth for his part, I perhaps could love,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said; "but nothing can my mind remove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hatred of the nation." He replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Good Sophonisba, you may leave this pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your city hath by us been three times beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last of which, you know, we laid it flat."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Pray use these words t' another, not to me,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said she; "if Africk mourn&egrave;d, Italy<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span><span class="i0">Needs not rejoice; search your records, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See what you gain&egrave;d by the Punic war."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that was friend to both, without reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little smiling, vanish'd from mine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst the crowd. As one in doubtful way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every step looks round, and fears to stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Care stops his journey), so the varied store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lovers stay'd me, to examine more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And try what kind of fire burnt every breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on my left hand stray&egrave;d from the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was one, whose look express'd a ready mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In seeking what he joy'd, yet shamed to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He freely gave away his dearest wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A new-found way to save a lover's life);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, though she joy'd, yet blush&egrave;d at the change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they recounted their affections strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for their Syria mourn'd; I took the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these three ghosts, who seem'd their course to stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take another path: the first I held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid him turn; he started, and beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me with a troubled look, hearing my tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Roman, such a pause he made as sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some deep thought; then spake as if inspired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to my wish, he told what I desired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know: "Seleucus is," said he, "my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is Antiochus my son, whose fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath reach'd your ear; he warr&egrave;d much with Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But reason oft by power is overcome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This woman, once my wife, doth now belong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him; I gave her, and it was no wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In our religion; it stay'd his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threaten'd by Love; Stratonica she hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To name: so now we may enjoy one state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our fast friendship shall outlast all date.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She from her height was willing to descend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I quit my joy; he rather chose his end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than our offence; and in his prime had died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not the wise Physician been our guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence in love o'ercame his vital part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love was force, his silence virtuous art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A father's tender care made me agree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this strange change." This said, he turn'd from me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere I could take my leave, he had quit the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the ghost was carried from mine eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazedly I walk'd; nor could untie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mind from his sad story; till my friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admonish'd me, and said, "You must not lend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attention thus to everything you meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know the number's great, and time is fleet."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More naked prisoners this triumph had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Xerxes soldiers in his army led:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch&egrave;d further than my sight could reach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of several countries, and of differing speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of a thousand were not known to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How he was catch&egrave;d by Andromeda:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a lovely brownet, black her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes. Narcissus, too, the foolish fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for his own love did himself destroy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had so much, he nothing could enjoy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, who for his loss, deep sorrow's slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed to a voice, dwells in a hollow cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iphis was there, who hasted his own fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved another, but himself did hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many more condemn'd like woes to prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose life was made a curse by hapless love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some modern lovers in my mind remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those to reckon here were needless pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two, whose constant loves for ever last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whom the winds wait while they build their nest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For halcyon days poor labouring sailors please.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fair Galatea lean'd on Acis' breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude Polyphemus' noise disturbs their rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glaucus alone swims through the dangerous seas,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who made him such, changed not his clothes nor name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His princely habit still appears the same.<br /></span>

<h3><i>Era s&igrave; pieno il cor di maraviglie.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">My</span> heart was fill'd with wonder and amaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one struck dumb, in silence stands at gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting counsel, when my friend drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "What do you look? why stay you here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mean you? know you not that I am one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, and must attend? pray, let's be gone."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear friend," said I, "consider what desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn the rest hath set my heart on fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My own haste stops me." "I believe 't," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And I will help; 'tis not forbidden me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This noble man, on whom the others wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You see) is Pompey, justly call'd The Great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cornelia followeth, weeping his hard fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ptolemy's unworthy causeless hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see far off the Grecian general;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His base wife, with &AElig;gisthus wrought his fall:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span><span class="i0">Behold them there, and judge if Love be blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here are lovers of another kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other faith they kept. Lynceus was saved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Hypermnestra: Pyramus bereaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself of life, thinking his mistress slain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thisbe's like end shorten'd her mourning pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leander, swimming often, drown'd at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hero her fair self from her window cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courteous Ulysses his long stay doth mourn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chaste wife prayeth for his safe return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Circe's amorous charms her prayers control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rather vex than please his virtuous soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hamilcar's son, who made great Rome afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a mean wench of Spain is captive led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Hypsicratea is, the virtuous fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for her husband's dear love cut her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And served in all his wars: this is the wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Brutus, Portia, constant in her life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death: this Julia is, who seems to moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Pompey lov&egrave;d best, when she was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look here and see the Patriarch much abused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who twice seven years for his fair Rachel choosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve: O powerful love increased by woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father this: now see his grandsire go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Sarah from his home. This cruel Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ercame good David; so it had power to move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His righteous heart to that abhorr&egrave;d crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which he sorrow'd all his following time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just such like error soil'd his wise son's fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whose idolatry God's anger came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's he who in one hour could love and hate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Tamar, full of anguish, wails her state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother Absalom attempts t' appease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her griev&egrave;d soul. Samson takes care to please<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fancy; and appears more strong than wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in a traitress' bosom sleeping lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst those pikes and spears which guard the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, wine, and sleep, a beauteous widow's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasing art hath Holophernes ta'en;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She back again retires, who hath him slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her one maid, bearing the horrid head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haste, and thanks God that so well she sped.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span><span class="i0">The next is Sichem, he who found his death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In circumcision; his father hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mischief felt; the city all did prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same effect of his rash violent love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see Ahasuerus how well he bears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His loss; a new love soon expels his cares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cure in this disease doth seldom fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One nail best driveth out another nail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you would see love mingled oft with hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bitter with sweet, behold fierce Herod's state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beset with love and cruelty at once:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enraged at first, then late his fault bemoans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mariamne calls; those three fair dames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who in the list of captives write their names)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procris, Deidamia, Artemisia were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All good, the other three as wicked are&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Semiramis, Byblis, and Myrrha named,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who of their crooked ways are now ashamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here be the erring knights in ancient scrolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lancelot, Tristram, and the vulgar souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wait on these; Guenever, and the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Isond, with other lovers; and the pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as they walk together, seem to plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their just, but cruel fate, by one hand slain."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he discoursed: and as a man that fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching harm, when he a trumpet hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starts at the blow ere touch'd, my frighted blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retired: as one raised from his tomb I stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by my side I spied a lovely maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(No turtle ever purer whiteness had!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straight was caught (who lately swore I would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defend me from a man at arms), nor could<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resist the wounds of words with motion graced:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image yet is in my fancy placed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend was willing to increase my woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling whisper'd,&mdash;"You alone may go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confer with whom you please, for now we are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All stained with one crime." My sullen care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like to theirs, who are more grieved to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another's happiness than their own woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For seeing her, who had enthrall'd my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live free in peace, and no disturbance find:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span><span class="i0">And seeing that I knew my hurt too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that her beauty was my dying fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, jealousy, and envy held my sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fix'd on that fair face, no other light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could behold; like one who in the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sickness greedily his thirst would 'suage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hurtful drink, which doth his palate please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus (blind and deaf t' all other joys are ease)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many doubtful ways I follow'd her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The memory still shakes my soul with fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since when mine eyes are moist, and view the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart is heavy, and my steps have found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solitary dwelling 'mongst the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stray o'er rocks and fountains, hills and floods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since when such store my scatter'd papers hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thoughts, of tears, of ink; which oft I fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfold, and tear: since when I know the scope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love, and what they fear, and what they hope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how they live that in his cloister dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skilful in their face may read it well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile I see, how fierce and gallant she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cares not for me, nor for my misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of her virtue, and my overthrow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the other side (if aught I know),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This lord, who hath the world in triumph led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She keeps in fear; thus all my hopes are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No strength nor courage left, nor can I be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenged, as I expected once; for he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tortures me and others, is abused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her; she'll not be caught, and long hath used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Rebellious as she is!) to shun his wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is a sun amidst the lesser stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her grace, smiles, slights, her words in order set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair dispersed or in a golden net;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes inflaming with a light divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So burn my heart, I dare no more repine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, who is able fully to express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pleasing ways, her merit? No excess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bold hyperboles I need to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My humble style cannot enough come near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth; my words are like a little stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compared with th' ocean, so large a theme<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span><span class="i0">Is that high praise; new worth, not seen before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen in her, and can be seen no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore all tongues are silenced; and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her prisoner now, see her at liberty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night and day implore (O unjust fate!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She neither hears nor pities my estate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard laws of Love! But though a partial lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plainly see in this, yet must I not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse to serve: the gods, as well as men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With like reward of old have felt like pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now know I how the mind itself doth part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Now making peace, now war, now truce)&mdash;what art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor lovers use to hide their stinging woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how their blood now comes, and now doth go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt their heart and cheeks, by shame or fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they be eloquent, yet speechless are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how they both ways lean, they watch and sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Languish to death, yet life and vigour keep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trod the paths made happy by her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And search the foe I am afraid to meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know how lovers metamorphosed are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that they love: I know what tedious care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel; how vain my joy, how oft I change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Design and countenance; and (which is strange)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I live without a soul: I know the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cheat myself a thousand times a day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know to follow while I flee my fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I freeze when present; absent, my desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hot: I know what cruel rigour Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Practiseth on the mind, and doth remove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All reason thence, and how he racks the heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how a soul hath neither strength nor art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a helper to resist his blows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he flees, and how his darts he throws:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how his threats the fearful lover feels:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he robs by force, and how he steals:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft his wheels turn round (now high, now low)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With how uncertain hope, how certain woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How all his promises be void of faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how a fire hid in our bones he hath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in our veins he makes a secret wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence open flames and death do soon abound.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span><span class="i0">In sum, I know how giddy and how vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be lovers' lives; what fear and boldness reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their ways; how every sweet is paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a double weight of sour allay'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I also know their customs, sighs, and songs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sudden muteness, and their stammering tongues:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How short their joy, how long their pain doth last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wormwood spoileth all their honey's taste.<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">When</span> once my will was captive by my fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had lost the liberty, which late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made my life happy; I, who used before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flee from Love (as fearful deer abhor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The following huntsman), suddenly became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Like all my fellow-servants) calm and tame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view'd the travails, wrestlings, and the smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crooked by-paths, and the cozening art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guides the amorous flock: then whilst mine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cast in every corner, to espy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some ancient or modern who had proved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famous, I saw him, who had only loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eurydice, and found out hell, to call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dear ghost back; he named her in his fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom he died. Ale&aelig;us there was known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilful in love and verse: Anacreon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose muse sung nought but love: Pindarus, he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was also there: there I might Virgil see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many brave wits I found, some looser rhymes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By others writ, hath pleased the ancient times:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ovid was one: after Catullus came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propertius next, his elegies the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cynthia bear: Tibullus, and the young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greek poetess, who is received among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble troop for her rare Sapphic muse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus looking here and there (as oft I use),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spied much people on a flowery plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst themselves disputes of love maintain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold Beatrice with Dante; Selvaggia, she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought her Pistoian Cino; Guitton may be<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wrote love in rhymes, but wrote their rhymes the worst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Franceschin and Sennuccio (whom all know)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were worthy and humane: after did go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A squadron of another garb and phrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom Arnaldo Daniel hath most praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great master in Love's art, his style, as new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sweet, honours his country: next, a few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Love did lightly wound: both Peters made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two: one, the less Arnaldo: some have had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A harder war; both the Rimbaldos, th' one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung Beatrice, though her quality was known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much above his reach in Montferrat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alvernia's old Piero, and Girault:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folchetto, who from Genoa was estranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call'd Marsilian, he wisely changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name, his state, his country, and did gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all: Jeffray made haste to catch his bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sails and oars: Guilliam, too, sweetly sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pleasing art, was cause he died so young.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amarig, Bernard, Hugo, and Anselm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were there, with thousands more, whose tongues were helm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shield, sword, and spear, all their offensive arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their defensive to prevent their harms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those I turn'd, comparing my own woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view my country-folks; and there might know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good Tomasso, who did once adorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bologna, now Messina holds his urn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, vanish'd joys! Ah, life too full of bane!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wert thou from mine eyes so quickly ta'en!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since without thee nothing is in my power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do, where art thou from me at this hour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is our life? If aught it bring of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sick man's dream, a fable told to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some few there from the common road did stray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">L&aelig;lius and Socrates, with whom I may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A longer progress take: Oh, what a pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dear esteem&egrave;d friends to me they were!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not my verse, nor prose, may reach thieir praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither of these can naked virtue raise<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span><span class="i0">Above her own true place: with them I have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach'd many heights; one yoke of learning gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laws to our steps, to them my fester'd wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I oft have show'd; no time or place I found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To part from them; and hope, and wish we may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be undivided till my breath decay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them I used (too early) to adorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head with th' honour'd branches, only worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her dear sake I did so deeply love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fill'd my thoughts; but ah! I daily prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fruit nor leaves from thence can gather'd be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The root hath sharp and bitter been to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this I was accustomed much to vex,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I have seen that which my anger checks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A theme for buskins, not a comic stage)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the God, adored by the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such dull fools as he had captive led:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first, I'll tell you what of us he made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from her hand what was his own sad fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Orpheus or Homer might relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His winged coursers o'er the ditches leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we their way as desperately kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he had reached where his mother reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would he ever pull or turn the reins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scour'd o'er woods and mountains; none did care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could discern in what strange world they were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the place, where old &AElig;geus mourns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An island lies, Ph&oelig;bus none sweeter burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Neptune ever bathed a better shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the midst a beauteous hill, with store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shades and pleasing smells, so fresh a spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As drowns all manly thoughts: this place doth bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus much joy; 't was given her deity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere blind man knew a truer god than she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which original it yet retains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much, so little goodness there remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it the vicious doth only please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is by the virtuous shunn'd as a disease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here this fine Lord insulteth o'er us all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tied in a chain, from Thule to Ganges' fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griefs in our breasts, vanity in our arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fleeting delights are there, and weighty harms:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span><span class="i0">Repentance swiftly following to annoy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such Tarquin found it, and the bane of Troy)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that whole valley with the echoes rung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of running brooks, and birds that gently sung:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banks were clothed in yellow, purple, green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarlet and white, their pleasing springs were seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gliding streams amongst the tender grass,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With her sweet sister, each their old task ta'en:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ah! how the faith in fortune placed is vain!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just in the time, and place, and in the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When humble tears should earthly joys devour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pleased him, whom th' vulgar honour so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To triumph over me; and now I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What miserable servitude they prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What ruin, and what death, that fall in love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Errors, dreams, paleness waiteth on his chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False fancies o'er the door, and on the stair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are slippery hopes, unprofitable gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gainful loss; such steps it doth contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As who descend, may boast their fortune best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who most ascend, most fall: a wearied rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And resting trouble, glorious disgrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A duskish and obscure illustriousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfaithful loyalty, and cozening faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nimble fury, lazy reason hath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prison, whose wide ways do all receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose narrow paths a hard retiring leave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steep descent, by which we slide with ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But find no hold our crawling steps to raise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within confusion, turbulence, annoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are mix'd; undoubted woe, and doubtful joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vulcano, where the sooty Cyclops dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liparis, Stromboli, nor Mongibel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Ischia, have more horrid noise and smoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hates himself that stoops to such a yoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus were we all throng'd in so strait a cage,<br /></span>

<h4>PART I.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">The</span> fatal morning dawn'd that brought again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad memorial of my ancient pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day, the source of long-protracted woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I began the plagues of Love to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyperion's throne, along the azure field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the splendid horns of Taurus wheel'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her spouse the Queen of Morn withdrew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sandals, gemm'd with frost-bespangled dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad recollection, rising with the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my disastrous love, repaid with scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppressed my sense; till welcome soft repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave a short respite from my swelling woes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seem'd I in a vision borne away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a deep winding vale sequester'd lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor long I rested on the flowery green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere a soft radiance dawn'd along the scene.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallacious sign of hope! for, close behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark shades of coming woe were seen combined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, on his car, a conqu'ring chief I spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Rome's proud sons, that led the living tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vanquished foes, in long triumphal state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Capitolian Jove's disclosing gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little joy I saw the splendid show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent and dejected by my lengthen'd woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick of the world, and all its worthless train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That world, where all the hateful passions reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet intent the mystic cause to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For knowledge is the banquet of the mind)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Languid and slow I turn'd my cheerless eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the proud warrior, and his uncouth guise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on his seat an archer youth was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loaded quiver, and malicious mien<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor plate, nor mail, his cruel shaft can ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor polish'd burganet the temples guard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His burning chariot seem'd by coursers drawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, like the snows that clothe the wintry lawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His waving wings with rainbow colour gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either naked shoulder seem'd to play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, filing far behind, a countless train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sad procession hid the groaning plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some, captive, seem'd in long disastrous strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some, in the deadly fray, bereft of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freshly wounded some. A viewless hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led me to mingle with the mornful band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn the fortunes of the sentenced crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, pierced by Love, had bid the world adieu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With keen survey I mark'd the ghostly show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find a shade among the sons of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To memory known: but every trace was lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dim features of the moving host:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oblivion's hand had drawn a dark disguise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er their wan lineaments and beamless eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, a pallid face I seem'd to know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which wore, methought, a lighter mask of woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He call'd me by my name.&mdash;"Behold!" he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What plagues the hapless thralls of Love abide!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How am I known by thee?" with new surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cried; "no mark recalls thee to my eyes."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, heavy is my load!" he seem'd to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Through this dark medium no detecting ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assists thy sight; but I, like thee, can boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My birth on famed Etruria's ancient coast."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret which his murky mask conceal'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His well-known voice and Tuscan tongue reveal'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence to a lighter station we repair'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the phantom spoke, with mild regard:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We thought to see thy name with ours enroll'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since; for oft thy looks this fate foretold."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"True," I replied; "but I survived the strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arrows reach'd me, but were short of life."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pausing, he spoke:&mdash;"A spark to flame will rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear thy name in glory to the skies."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His meaning was obscure, but in my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt the substance of his words impress'd,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span><span class="i0">As sculptured stone, or monumental brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps the firm record, or heroic face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With youthful ardour new, and hope inspired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick from my grave companion I required<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name and fortunes of the passing train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why in mournful pomp they trod the plain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Time," he return'd, "the secret then will show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou shalt join the retinue of woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But years shall sprinkle o'er thy locks with gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And alter'd looks the signs of age betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere at his powerful touch the fetters fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which many a moon thy captive limbs shall gall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will I grant thy suit, and give to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The various fortunes of the captive crew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mark their leader first, that chief renown'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Power of Love! by every nation own'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sway thou soon, as well as we, shalt know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung to the heart by goads of dulcet woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him unthinking youth's misgovern'd rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join'd with the cool malignity of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is known to mingle with insidious guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep, deep conceal'd beneath an infant's smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child of slothful ease, and sensual heat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sweet delirious thoughts, in dark retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mature in mischief grown&mdash;he springs away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wing&egrave;d god, and thousands own his sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some, as thou seest, are number'd with the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some the bitter drops of sorrow shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through lingering life, by viewless tangles bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That link the soul, and chain it to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There C&aelig;sar walks! of Celtic laurels proud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor feels himself in sensual bondage bow'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He treads the flowery path, nor sees the snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid for his honour by the Egyptian fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Love his triumph shows, and leads along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's great owner in the captive throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the master of unscepter'd kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting soars, and claps his purple wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See his adopted son! he knew her guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobly scorn'd the siren of the Nile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fell by Roman charms and from her spouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pregnant consort bore, regardless of her vows<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span><span class="i0">There, cruel Nero feels his iron heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lanced by imperious Love's resistless dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replete with rage, and scorning human ties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls the victim of two conquering eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep ambush'd there in philosophic spoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little tyrant tries his artful wiles:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en in that hallow'd breast, where, deep enshrined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay all the varied treasures of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lodged his venom'd shaft. The hoary sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like meaner mortals, felt the passion rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In boundless fury for a strumpet's charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasp'd the shining mischief in his arms.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Dionysius link'd with Pher&aelig;'s lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale doubt and dread on either front abhorr'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scowl terrible! yet Love assign'd their doom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wife and mistress mark'd them for the tomb!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next is he that on Antandros' coast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fair Cr&euml;usa mourn'd, for ever lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet cut the bonds of Love on Tyber's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bought a bride with young Evander's gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here droop'd the victim of a lawless flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The amorous frenzy of the Cretan dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fled abhorrent, and contemn'd her tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the dire suggestion closed his ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought, alas! his purity avail'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate in his flight the hapless youth assail'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By interdicted Love to Vengeance fired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his father's curse the son expired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stepdame shared his fate, and dearly paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spouse, a sister, and a son betray'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her conscience, by the false impeachment stung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon herself return'd the deadly wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, that broke before his plighted vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met his deserts in an adulterous spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! where he droops between the sister dames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fondly melts&mdash;the other scorns his flames,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty slave of Omphale behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen, and he whom Love and fraud combined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent to the shades of everlasting night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he seems to weep his wretched plight.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, Phyllis mourns Demophoon's broken vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell Medea there pursues her spouse;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span><span class="i0">With impious boast, and shrill upbraiding cries,<br /></span>

<h4>PART II.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Thus</span>, as I view'd th' interminable host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prospect seem'd at last in dimness lost:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the wish remain'd their doom to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, watchful, I survey'd the passing show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As each majestic form emerged to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither, intent, I turn'd my sharpen'd sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon a noble pair my notice drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, hand in hand approaching, met my view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gentle parley, and communion sweet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks of love, they seem'd mine eyes to meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet strange was their attire&mdash;their tongue unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke them the natives of a distant zone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every doubt my kind assistant clear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant I knew them, when their names were heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one, encouraged by his aspect mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spoke&mdash;the other with a frown recoil'd.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Masinissa!"&mdash;thus my speech began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"By Scipio's friendship, and the gentle ban<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of constant love, attend my warm request."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning around, the solemn shade address'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His answer thus:&mdash;"With like desire I glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your lineage, name, and character, to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since you have learnt my name." With soft reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said, "A name like mine can nought supply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The notice of renown like yours to claim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No smother'd spark like mine emits a flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the public eye, as you can boast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leading name in Cupid's numerous host!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike his future victims and the past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall own the common tie, while time itself shall last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me (if your guide allow a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The semblance of those tendant shades to trace)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The names and fortunes of the following pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seem the noblest gifts of mind to share."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My name," he said, "you seem to know so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That faithful Memory all the rest can tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the sad detail may soothe my woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen, while I my mournful doom disclose:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rome and Scipio's cause my faith was bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en L&aelig;lius scarce a warmer friendship own'd:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span><span class="i0">Where'er their ensigns fann'd the summer sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I led my Libyans on, a firm ally;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propitious Fortune still advanced his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more than she bestow'd, his worth might claim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still we advanced, and still our glory grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While westward far the Roman eagle flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With conquest wing'd; but my unlucky star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led me, unconscious, to the fatal snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Love had laid. I saw the regal dame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts at once confess'd a mutual flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught by the lure of interdicted joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proudly I scorn'd the stern forbidding voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Roman policy; and hoped the vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Hymen's altar sworn, might save my spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! that wondrous man, who ne'er would yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To passion's call, the cruel sentence seal'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tore my consort from my fond embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left me sunk in anguish and disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved he saw my briny sorrows flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved he listen'd to my tale of woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But friendship, waked at last, with reverent awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obsequious, own'd his mind's superior law;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to that holy and unclouded light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That led him on through passion's dubious night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Submiss I bow'd; for, oh! the beam of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dark to him that wants her guiding ray!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, hardly conquer'd, long repined in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Justice link'd the adamantine chain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cruel Friendship o'er the conquer'd ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised with strong hand th' insuperable mound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him I owed my laurels nobly won&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved him as a brother, sire, and son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in an equal race our lives had run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the sad price I paid with burning tears;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire was the cause that woke my gloomy fears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too well the sad result my soul divined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too well I knew the unsubmitting mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sophonisba would prefer the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stern captivity's ignoble doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, too, sad victim of celestial wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was forced to aid the tardy stroke of death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pangs I yielded to her piercing cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed her passage to the nether skies;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span><span class="i0">And worse than death endured, her mind to save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From shame, more hateful than the yawning grave.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was my anguish, when she seized the bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knows! and you, whose sympathising soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has felt the fiery shaft, may guess my pains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now tears and anguish are her sole remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That treasure, to preserve my faith to Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hands committed to th' untimely tomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every hope and joy of life resign'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the stain of falsehood from my mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hasten, and the moving pomp survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The light-wing'd moments brook no long delay),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try if any form your notice claims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those love-lorn youths and amorous dames."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With poignant grief I heard his tale of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seem'd to melt my heart like vernal snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a low voice these sullen accents sung:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not for himself, but those from whom he sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He merits fate; for I detest them all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whose fell rage I owe my country's fall."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, calm your rage, unhappy Queen!" I cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Twice was the land and sea in slaughter dyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cruel Carthage, till the sentence pass'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That laid her glories in the dust at last."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet mournful wreaths no less the victors crown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deep despair our valour oft they own'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your own impartial annals yet proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Punic glory and the Roman shame."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke&mdash;and with a smile of hostile spite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join'd the deep train, and darken'd to my sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as a traveller through lands unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With care and keen observance journeys on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose dubious thoughts his eager steps retard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus through the files I pass'd with fix'd regard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still singling some amid the moving show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent the story of their loves to know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spectre now within my notice came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dubious marks of joy, commix'd with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His features wore, like one who gains a boon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With secret glee, which shame forbids to own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O dire example of the Demon's power!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father leaves the hymeneal bower<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span><span class="i0">For his incestuous son; the guilty spouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With transport mix'd with honour, meets his vows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mournful converse now, amidst the host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their compact they bewail'd, and Syria lost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant, with eager step, I turn'd aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And met the double husband, and the bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with an earnest voice the first address'd:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of dread the spectre's face express'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first the accents of victorious Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought to his mind his kingdom's ancient doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, with many a doleful sigh, he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You here behold Seleucus' royal shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antiochus is next; his life to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ready hand my beauteous consort gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(From me, whose will was law, a legal prize,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bound our souls in everlasting ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indissolubly strong. The royal fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook a throne to cure the deep despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, who would have dared the stroke of Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep, without a stain, his filial faith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A skilful leech the deadly symptoms guess'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His throbbing veins the secret soon confess'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love with honour match'd, in dire debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenever he beheld my lovely mate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else gentle Love, subdued by filial dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sent him down among th' untimely dead."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a man that feels a sudden thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purpose change, the mingling crowd he sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the question, which a moment hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce half suppress'd upon my faltering tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspended for a moment, still I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With various thoughts oppress'd in musing mood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length a voice was heard, "The passing day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is yours, but it permits not long delay."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn'd in haste, and saw a fleeting train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outnumbering those who pass'd the surging main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Xerxes led&mdash;a naked wailing crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wretched plight the drops of sorrow drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my full eyes.&mdash;Of many a clime and tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commix'd the mournful pageant moved along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While scarce the fortunes or the name of one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among a thousand passing forms was known.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span><span class="i0">I spied that Ethiopian's dusky charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which woke in Perseus' bosom Love's alarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next was he who for a shadow burn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the deceitful watery glass return'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enamour'd of himself, in sad decay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid abundance, poor&mdash;he look'd his life away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now transform'd through passion's baneful power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He o'er the margin hangs, a drooping flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, by her hopeless love congeal'd to stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mistress seems to look in silence on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he that loved, by too severe a fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruel maid who met his love with hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass'd by; with many more who met their doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By female pride, and fill'd an early tomb.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There too, the victim of her plighted vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halcyone for ever mourns her spouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who now, in feathers clad, as poets feign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes a short summer on the wintry main.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he that to the cliffs the maid pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seem'd by turns to soar, and swim the flood;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, who, snared by Love, her father sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, who fondly snared the rolling gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her young paramour, who made his boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had gain'd the prize his rival lost.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acis and Galatea next were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Polyphemus with infuriate mien;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Glaucus there, by rival arts assail'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell Circe's hate and Scylla's doom bewail'd.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sad Carmenta, with her royal lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the fell sorceress clad, by arts abhorr'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With plumes; but still the regal stamp impress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his imperial wings and lofty crest.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, whose tears the springing fount supplied;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she whose form above the rolling tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs a portentous cliff&mdash;the royal fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wrote the dictates of her last despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him whose ships had left the friendly strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the keen steel in her determined hand.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, too, Pygmalion, with his new-made spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many more, I spied, whose amorous vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fates in never-dying song resound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Aganippe laves the sacred ground:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span><span class="i0">And, last of all, I saw the lovely maid<br /></span>

<h4>PART III.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Like</span> one by wonder reft of speech, I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pond'ring the mournful scene in pensive mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one that waits advice. My guide in haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began:&mdash;"You let the moments run to waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What objects hold you here?&mdash;my doom you know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compell'd to wander with the sons of woe!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, yet awhile afford your friendly aid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see my inmost soul;" submiss I said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The strong unsated wish you there can read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The restless cravings of my mind to feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings of the dead."&mdash;In gentler tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "Your longings in your looks are known;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You wish to learn the names of those behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who through the vale in long procession wind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grant your prayer, if fate allows a space,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "their fortunes, as they come, to trace.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that majestic shade that moves along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And claims obeisance from the ghostly throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis Pompey; with the partner of his vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who mourns the fortunes of her slaughter'd spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Egypt's servile band.&mdash;The next is he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Love's tyrannic spell forbade to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The danger by his cruel consort plann'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Fate surprised him by her treacherous hand.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let constancy and truth exalt the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her, the lovely candidate for fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saved her spouse!&mdash;Then Pyramus is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thisbe, through the shade, with pensive mien;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Hero with Leander moves along,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great Ulysses, towering in the throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His visage wears the signs of anxious thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sad Penelope laments her lot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trickling tears she seems to chide his stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fond Calypso charms her love-delay.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next he who braved in many a bloody fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For years on years, the whole collected might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rome, but sunk at length in Cupid's snare<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span><span class="i0">The shameful victim of th' Apulian fair!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, that, in a servile dress pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Reft of her golden locks) o'er field and flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With peerless faith, her exiled spouse unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom of old she fill'd a lofty throne.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Portia comes, who fire and steel defied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Julia, grieved to see a second bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engage her consort's love.&mdash;The Hebrew swain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears, who sold himself his love to gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For seven long summers&mdash;a vivacious flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which neither years nor constant toil could tame!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Isaac, with his father, joins the band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, with his consort, left at God's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by the lamp of faith, his native land.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">David is next, by lawless passion sway'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, adding crime to crime, at last betray'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deeds of blood, till solitude and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wash'd his dire guilt away, and calm'd his fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sensual vapour, with Circean fume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved his royal son in deeper gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimm'd his glory, till, immersed in vice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart renounced the Ruler of the Skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adopting Stygian gods.&mdash;The changeful hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his incestuous brother meets your view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lurks behind: observe the sudden turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love and hatred blanch his cheek, and burn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ruin'd sister there, with frantic speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Absalom recounts the direful deed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Samson behold, a prey to female fraud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong, but unwise, he laid the pledge of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her fallacious lap, who basely sold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband's honour for Philistian gold.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judith is nigh, who, mid a host in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle accents and alluring charms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their chief o'ercame, and, at the noon of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his pavilion sped her venturous flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one attendant slave, who bore along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant's head amid the hostile throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adoring Him who arms the feeble hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids the weak a mighty foe withstand.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy Sichem next is seen, who paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bloody ransom for an injured maid:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span><span class="i0">His guiltless sire and all his slaughter'd race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a life, attend the foul disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the ruin by a sudden gust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion caused, when murder follow'd lust!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other, like a wise physician, cured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An abject passion, long with pain endured:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Vashti for an easy boon he sued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scorn'd his suit, and rage his love subdued:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon to its aid a softer passion came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his breast expell'd the former flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like wedge by wedge displaced, the nuptial ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breaks, and soon another bride supplies.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you wish to see the bosom (war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jealousy and Love) in deadly jar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold that royal Jew! the dire control<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love and Hate by turns besiege his soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Vengeance wins the day&mdash;the deed is done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, in fell remorse, he hates the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls his consort from the realms of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which his fatal hand had sped her flight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold yon hapless three, by passion lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procris, and Artemisia's royal ghost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her, whose son (his mother's grief and joy)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Razed with paternal rage the walls of Troy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another triple sisterhood is seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This characters of Hades. Mark their mien<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sin distain'd: their downcast looks disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A conscience of their crimes, and dread of coming woes.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Semiramis, and Byblis (famed of old)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother's rival there you next behold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a warrior, many a lovely dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old, ennobled by romantic fame.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Lancelot and Tristram (famed in fight)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are seen, with many a dame and errant knight;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Genevra, Belle Isonde, and hundreds more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those who mingled their incestuous gore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed by paternal rage; and chant beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In baneful symphony, the Song of Death."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scarce had spoken, when a chill presage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What warriors feel before the battle's rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the angry trump's sonorous breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hear, before it comes, the sound of Death)<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span><span class="i0">My heart possess'd; and, tinged with deadly pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem'd escaped from Death's eternal jail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, fleeting to my side with looks of Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A phantom brighter than the Cyprian dove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fingers clasp'd; which, though of power to wield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temper'd sabre in the bloody field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against an armed foe, a touch subdued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle words, and looks that fired the blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend addressed me (I remember well),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his lips these dubious accents fell:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Converse with whom you please, for all the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are mark'd alike the slaves of Cupid's reign."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, in security and peace trepann'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was enlisted in that wayward band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who short-lived joys by anguish long obtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom the pleasures of a rival pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than their proper joys. Remembrance shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too clear at last the source of all my woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jealousy, and Love, and Envy drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nurture from my heart by which they grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As feverish eyes on air-drawn features dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fascinated eyes, by magic spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwell'd on the heavenly form with ardent look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at a glance the dire contagion took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tinged my days to come; and each delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those that bore her stamp, consign'd to night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I blush with shame when to my inward view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The devious paths return where Cupid drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His willing slave, with all my hopes and fears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Ph&oelig;bus seem'd to rise and set in tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a spring&mdash;and when I used to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lonely hermit in a silent cell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How upwards oft I traced the purling rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their pure fountains in the misty hills!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks I used to climb, the solemn woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oft I wander'd by the winding floods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often spent, whene'er I chanced to stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In amorous ditties all the livelong day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mournful rhymes I wrote and 'rased again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spending the precious hours of youth in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas in this school I learn'd the mystic things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blind god, and all the secret springs<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span><span class="i0">From which his hopes and fears alternate rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Graved on his frontlet, the detection lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all may read, for I have oped their eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, the cause of all my lengthen'd toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdains my passion, though she boasts my spoils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rigid honour proud, she smiles to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal triumph of her charms in me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Love himself can aid, for Love retires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her sacred presence veils his fires:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feels his genius by her looks subdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his spells by stronger spells withstood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence my despair; for neither force nor art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can wound her bosom, nor extract the dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rankles here, while proudly she defies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power that makes a captive world his prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is not one that dallies with the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with unconquer'd soul defies the blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the Lord of Light, displays afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A splendour which obscures each lesser star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her port is all divine; her radiant smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en her scorn, the captive heart beguile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her accents breathe of heaven; her auburn hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whether it wanton with the sportive air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bound in shining wreaths adorns her face,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secures her conquests with resistless grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes, that sparkle with celestial fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have render'd me the slave of fond desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who can raise his style to match her charms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mortal bard can sing the soft alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flutter in the breast, and fire the veins?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! the theme surmounts the loftiest strains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as the ocean in its ample bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeds the purling stream that warbles through the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such charms are hers&mdash;as never were reveal'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth, since Ph&oelig;bus first the world beheld!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And voices, tuned her peerless form to praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffer a solemn pause with mute amaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus was I manacled for life; while she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of my bonds, enjoy'd her liberty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ceaseless suit I pray'd, but all in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One prayer among a thousand scarce could gain<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span><span class="i0">A slight regard&mdash;so hopeless was my state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such the laws of Love imposed by fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stedfast is the rule by Nature given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all the ranks of life, from earth to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reverent awe and homage due obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every age and climate owns its sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the cruel pangs by lovers borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the breast the bleeding heart is torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Love's relentless gripe; the deadly harms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cupid, when he wields resistless arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when, in dubious truce, he drops his dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives short respite to the tortured heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vital current's ebb and flood I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When shame or anger bids the features glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or terror pales the cheek; the deadly snake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know that nestles in the flowery brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, watchful, seems to sleep, and languor feigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When health-inspiring vigour fills the veins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know what hope and fear assail the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I pursue my love, yet dread to find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the strange and sympathetic tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, soul in soul transfused, a fond ally<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever seems another and the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or change with mutual love their mortal frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From transient smiles to long protracted woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The various turns and dark degrees I know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hot and cold, and that unequall'd smart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When souls survive, though sever'd from the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know, I cherish, and detect the cheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every hour; but still, with eager feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fervent hope, pursue the flying fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still for promised rapture meet despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When absent, I consume in raging fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in her presence check'd, the flames expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repress'd by sacred awe. The boundless sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cruel Love I feel, that makes a prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all those energies that lift the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her congenial climes above the pole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the various pangs that rend the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know that noblest souls receive the dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without defence, when Reason drops the shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, recreant, to her foe resigns the field.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span><span class="i0">I saw the archer in his airy flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him when he check'd his arrow's flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it reach'd the mark, I watched the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw him win his way by force or fraud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best befits his ends. His whirling throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns short at will, or runs directly on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapid follies which his axle bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are short fallacious hope and certain fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a promise given of Halcyon days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose faint and dubious gleam the heart betrays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know what secret flame the marrow fries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in the veins a dormant fever lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, fann'd to fury by contagious breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It gains tremendous head, and ends in death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know too well what long and doubtful strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forms the dire tissue of a lover's life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The transient taste of sweet commix'd with gall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What changes dire the hapless crew befall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their strange fantastic habitudes I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their measured groans in lamentable flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rhyming-fits the faltering tongue employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love sick spasms the mournful Muse annoy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smile that like the lightning fleets away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrows that for half a life delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like drops of honey in a wormwood bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drain'd to the dregs in bitterness of soul.<br /></span>

<h4>PART IV.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">So</span> fickle fortune, in a luckless hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had close consigned me to a tyrant's power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cut the nerves that, with elastic force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had borne me on in Freedom's generous course&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I, in noble independence bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free as the roebuck in the sylvan glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By passion lured, a voluntary slave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ready name to Cupid's muster gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I saw their grief and wild despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw them blindly seek the fatal snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through winding paths, and many an artful maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Cupid's viewless spell the band obeys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, as I turn'd my anxious eyes around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any shade I then could see renown'd<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span><span class="i0">In old or modern times; the bard I spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose unabated love pursued his bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the coast of Hades; and above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life resign'd, the pledge of constant love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling her name in death.&mdash;Alc&aelig;us near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sung the joys of Love and toils severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen with Pindar and the Teian swain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A veteran gay among the youthful train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cupid's host.&mdash;The Mantuan next I found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begirt with bards from age to age renown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they chose in lofty themes to soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sportive try the Muse's lighter lore.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There soft Tibullus walk'd with Sulmo's bard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there Propertius with Catullus shared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meed of lovesome lays: the Grecian dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweeter numbers woke the amorous flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus I turn'd around my wondering eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a noble train with new surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seem'd of Love in choral notes to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all around them breathed Elysian spring.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Alighieri, with his love I spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selvaggia, Guido, Cino, side by side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guido, who mourn'd the lot that fix'd his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second of his age in lyric fame.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two other minstrels there I spied that bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name, renown'd on Arno's tuneful shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them Sicilia's bards, in elder days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Match'd with the foremost in poetic praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now they rank behind.&mdash;Sennuccio nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle Franceschino met my eye.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon another tribe, of manners strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uncouth dialect, was seen to range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the flowery paths, by Arnald led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Cupid's lore by all the Muses bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And master of the theme.&mdash;Marsilia's coast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Narbonne still his polish'd numbers boast.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next I saw with lighter step advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas he that caught a flame at every glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That met his eye, with him who shared his name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join'd with an Arnald of inferior fame.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next either Rambold in procession trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No easy conquest to the winged god.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span><span class="i0">The pride of Montferrat (a peerless dame)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a ditty sung, announced his flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Genoa's bard, who left his native coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on Marsilia's towers the memory lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his first time, when Salem's sacred flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught him a nobler heritage to claim,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gerard and Peter, both of Gallic blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tuneful Rudel, who, in moonstruck mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er ocean by a flying image led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the fantastic chase his canvas spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where he thought his amorous vows to breathe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Cupid's bow received the shaft of Death.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was Cabestaing, whose unequall'd lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all his rivals won superior praise.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hugo was there, with Almeric renown'd;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bernard and Anselm by the Muses crown'd.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those and a thousand others o'er the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced; nor javelin did they want, or shield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muses form'd their guard, and march'd before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading their long renown from shore to shore.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latian band, with sympathising woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last I spied amid the moving show:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bologna's poet first, whose honour'd grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His relics hold beside Messina's wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fickle joys, that fleet upon the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the lassitude of life behind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth, that every thought and movement sway'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this sad heart, is now an empty shade!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What world contains thee now, my tuneful guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom nought of old could sever from my side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is this life?&mdash;what none but fools esteem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fleeting shadow, a romantic dream!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far I wander'd o'er the peopled field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Socrates and L&aelig;lius I beheld.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, may their holy influence never cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soothed my heart-corroding pangs to peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unequall'd friends! no bard's ecstatic lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor polish'd prose your deathless name can raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match your genuine worth! O'er hill and dale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pass'd, and oft I told my doleful tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclosing all my wounds, end not in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sacred presence seem'd to soothe my pain.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span><span class="i0">Oh, may that glorious privilege be mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till dust to dust the final stroke resign!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My courage they inspired to claim the wreath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal emblem of my constant faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her whose name the poet's garland bears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nought from her, for long devoted years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reap'd but cold disdain, and fruitless tears.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon a sight ensued, that, like a spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restrain'd at once my passion's stormy swell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this a loftier muse demands to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hallow'd power that pruned the daring wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that blind force, by folly canonized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the garb of deity disguised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet first the conscious muse designs to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I endured and 'scaped his witching spell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A subject that demands a muse of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious theme, that Ph&oelig;bus might inspire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy of Homer and the Orphean lyre!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, as along the whirling chariot flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kept the wafture of his wings in view:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onward his snow-white steeds were seen to bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er many a steepy hill and dale profound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, victims of his rage, the captive throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chain'd to the flying wheels, were dragg'd along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All torn and bleeding, through the thorny waste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew I how the land and sea he pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till to his mother's realm he came at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far eastward, where the vext &AElig;gean roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little isle projects its verdant shores:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft is the clime, and fruitful is the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairer spot old ocean clips around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Sol himself surveys from east to west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweeter scene in summer livery drest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the midst ascends a shady hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where down its bowery slopes a streaming rill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dulcet murmurs flows, and soft perfume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The senses court from many a vernal bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with magic; which the senses steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sloth, and drug the mind in Lethe's deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quenching the spark divine&mdash;the genuine boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man, in Circe's wave immersed and lost.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span><span class="i0">This favour'd region of the Cyprian queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received its freight&mdash;a heaven-abandon'd scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Falsehood fills the throne, while Truth retires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly mourns her half-extinguish'd fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vile in its origin, and viler still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all incentives that seduce the will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems Elysium to the sons of Lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a foul dungeon to the good and just.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting o'er his slaves, the winged God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in a theatre his triumphs show'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ample to hold within its mighty round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His captive train, from Thule's northern bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To far Taprobane, a countless crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, to the archer boy, adoring, bow'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad fantoms shook above their Gorgon wings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fantastic longings for unreal things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fugitive delights, and lasting woes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer's biting frost, and winter's rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And penitence and grief, that dragg'd along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal lawless pair, that poets sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, by his Spartan plunder, seal'd the doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hapless Troy&mdash;the other rescued Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath, as if in mockery of their woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tumbling flood, with murmurs deep and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return'd their wailings; while the birds above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet aerial descant fill'd the grove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all beside the river's winding bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh flowers in gay confusion deck'd the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painting the sod with every scent and hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Flora's breath affords, or drinks the morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a solemn bower, with welcome shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the dusky stream a shelter made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sun withdrew his slanting ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winter cool'd the fervours of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the genial hours, the frequent feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And circling times of joy and balmy rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New day and night were poised in even scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spring awoke her equinoctial gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Progne now and Philomel begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With genial toils to greet the vernal sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just then&mdash;O hapless mortals! that rely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fickle fortune's ever-changing sky&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span><span class="i0">E'en in that season, when, with sacred fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dan Cupid seem'd his subjects to inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That warms the heart, and kindles in the look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all beneath the moon obey his yoke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the sad reverse that lovers own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the slaves beneath their bondage groan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw them sink beneath the deadly weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long tortures that forerun their fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad disappointments there in meagre forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen, and feverish dreams, and fancied harms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fantoms rising from the yawning tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen to muster in the gathering gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the car; and some were seen to climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While cruel fate reversed their steps sublime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empty notions in the port were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And baffled hopes were there with cloudy mien.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was expensive gain, and gain that lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amorous schemes by fortune's favour cross'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearisome repose, and cares that slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was the semblance of disgrace, that kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth from dire mischance on whom it fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glory darken'd on the gloom of hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfidious loyalty, and honest fraud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wisdom slow, and headlong thirst of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dungeon, where the flowery paths decoy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The painful, hard escape, with long annoy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the smooth descent the foot betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the steep rocky path that leads again to day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the gloomy gulf confusion storm'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moody rage its wildest freaks perform'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settled grief was there; and solid night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But rarely broke with fitful gleams of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From joy's fantastic hand. Not Vulcan's forge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his Cyclopean caves the fumes disgorge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the deep mine of Mongibel, that throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiery tempest o'er eternal snows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Lipari, whose strong sulphureous blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ercanopies with flames the watery waste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Stromboli, that sweeps the glowing sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With red combustion, with its rage could vie.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little he loves himself that ventures there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there is ceaseless woe and fell despair:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet, in this dolorous dungeon long confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till time had grizzled o'er my locks, I pined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, dreaming still of liberty to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spent my summers in this noisome gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still a dubious joy my grief controll'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spy such numbers in that darksome hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon to gall my seeming transport turn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my illustrious partner's fate I mourn'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often seem'd, with sympathising woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To melt in solvent tears like vernal snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn'd away, but, with inverted glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perused the fleeting shapes that fill'd my trance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him that feels a moment's short delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a fine picture fleets before his sight.<br /></span>

<h2>THE TRIUMPH OF CHASTITY.</h2>

<h3><i>Quando ad un giogo ed in Un tempo quivi.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">When</span> to one yoke at once I saw the height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gods and men subdued by Cupid's might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took example from their cruel fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by their sufferings eased my own hard state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Ph&oelig;bus and Leander felt like pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one a god, the other but a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One snare caught Juno and the Carthage dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Her husband's death prepared her funeral flame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas not a cause that Virgil maketh one);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I need not grieve, that unprepared, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarm'd, and young, I did receive a wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that my enemy no hurt hath found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Love; or that she clothed him in my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took his wings, and marr'd his winding flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No angry lions send more hideous noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their beat breasts, nor clashing thunder's voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rends heaven, frights earth, and roareth through the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greater force than Love had raised, to dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encounter her of whom I write; and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As quick and ready to assail as he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enceladus when Etna most he shakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor angry Scylla, nor Charybdis makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great and frightful noise, as did the shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this (first doubtful) battle: none could mock<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span><span class="i0">Such earnest war; all drew them to the height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see what 'mazed their hearts and dimm'd their sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victorious Love a threatening dart did show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right hand held; the other bore a bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The string of which he drew just by his ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No leopard could chase a frighted deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Free, or broke loose) with quicker speed than he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made haste to wound; fire sparkled from his eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I burn'd, and had a combat in my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad t' have her company, yet 'twas not best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Methought) to see her lost, but 'tis in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T' abandon goodness, and of fate complain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue her servants never will forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now 'twas seen, she could resistance make:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fencer ever better warded blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pilot did to shore more wisely row<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun a shelf, than with undaunted power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She waved the stroke of this sharp conqueror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes and heart were watchful to attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hope the victory would that way bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It ever did; and that I might no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be barr'd from her; as one whose thoughts before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tongue hath utter'd them you well may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writ in his looks; "Oh! if you victor be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great sir," said I, "let her and me be bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both with one yoke; I may be worthy found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will not set her free, doubt not my faith:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I beheld her with disdain and wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fill'd, that to relate it would demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A better muse than mine: her virtuous hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had quickly quench'd those gilded fiery darts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, dipp'd in beauty's pleasure, poison hearts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither Camilla, nor the warlike host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cut their breasts, could so much valour boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor C&aelig;sar in Pharsalia fought so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she 'gainst him who pierceth coats of mail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All her brave virtues arm'd, attended there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A glorious troop!) and marched pair by pair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour and blushes first in rank; the two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religious virtues make the second row;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(By those the other women doth excel);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prudence and Modesty, the twins that dwell<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span><span class="i0">Together, both were lodg&egrave;d in her breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory and Perseverance, ever blest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Entertainment, Providence without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Courtesy, and Pureness round about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect of credit, fear of infamy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave thoughts in youth; and, what not oft agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True Chastity and rarest Beauty; these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All came 'gainst Love, and this the heavens did please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every generous soul in that full height.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no power left to bear the weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand famous prizes hardly gain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took; and thousand glorious palms obtained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook from his hands; the fall was not more strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hannibal, when Fortune pleased to change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mind, and on the Roman youth bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The favours he enjoy'd; nor was he so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed who frighted the Israelitish host&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck by the Hebrew boy, that quit his boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Cyrus more astonish'd at the fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Jewish widow gave his general:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one that sickens suddenly, and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life, or as a man ta'en unawares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some base act, and doth the finder hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so was he, or in a worse estate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear, grief, and shame, and anger, in his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen: no troubled seas more rage: the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where huge Typh&oelig;us groans, nor Etna, when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her giant sighs, were moved as he was then.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pass by many noble things I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(To write them were too hard a task for me),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her and those that did attend I go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her armour was a robe more white than snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her hand a shield like his she bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who slew Medusa; a fair pillar there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of jasp was next, and with a chain (first wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Lethe flood) of jewels fitly set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diamonds, mix'd with topazes (of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas worn by ladies, now 'tis not) first hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She caught, then bound him fast; then such revenge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took as might suffice. My thoughts did change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, who wish'd him victory before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was satisfied he now could hurt no more.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span><span class="i0">I cannot in my rhymes the names contain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bless&egrave;d maids that did make up her train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calliope nor Clio could suffice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the other seven, for th' enterprise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some I will insert may justly claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Precedency of others. Lucrece came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her right hand; Penelope was by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those broke his bow, and made his arrows lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split on the ground, and pull'd his plumes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off his wings: after, Virginia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near her vex'd father, arm'd with wrath and hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fury, and iron, and love, he freed the state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her from slavery, with a manly blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next were those barbarous women, who could show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They judged it better die than suffer wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their rude chastity; the wise and strong&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chaste Hebr&aelig;an Judith follow'd these;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greek that saved her honour in the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these and other famous souls I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her triumph over him who used to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master of all the world: among the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vestal nun I spied, who was so bless'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by a wonder to preserve her fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next came Hersilia, the Roman dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Or Sabine rather), with her valorous train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who prove all slanders on that sex are vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, 'mongst the foreign ladies, she whose faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T' her husband (not &AElig;neas) caused her death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vulgar ignorant may hold their peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her safety to her chastity gave place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dido, I mean, whom no vain passion led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As fame belies her); last, the virtuous maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retired to Arno, who no rest could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her friends' constraining power forced her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Triumph thither went where salt waves wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Baian shore eastward; her foot she set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on firm land, and did Avernus leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the one hand, on th' other Sybil's cave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to Linternus march'd, the village where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble Africane lies buried; there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great news of her triumph did appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As glorious to the eye as to the ear<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span><span class="i0">The fame had been; and the most chaste did show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most beautiful; it grieved Love much to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another's prisoner, exposed to scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who to command whole empires seem&egrave;d born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the chiefest city all were led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering the temple which Sulpicia made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred; it drives all madness from the mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chastity's pure temple next we find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in brave souls doth modest thoughts beget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by plebeians enter'd, but the great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patrician dames; there were the spoils display'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the fair victress; there her palms she laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did commit them to the Tuscan youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose marring scars bear witness of his truth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With others more, whose names I fully knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(My guide instructed me,) that overthrew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of Love: 'mongst whom, of all the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippolytus and Joseph were the best.<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">When</span> gods and men I saw in Cupid's chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promiscuous led, a long uncounted train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sad example taught, I learn'd at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom's best rule&mdash;to profit from the past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some solace in the numbers too I found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those that mourn'd, like me, the common wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ph&oelig;bus felt, a mortal beauty's slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That urged Leander through the wintry wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That jealous Juno with Eliza shared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose more than pious hands the flame prepared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mix'd her ashes with her murder'd spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dire completion of her nuptial vows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For not the Trojan's love, as poets sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her wan bosom fix'd the secret string.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why should I of common ills complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot by a random shaft, a thoughtless swain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarm'd and unprepared to meet the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My naked bosom seem'd to court the blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cause, at least, to soothe my grief ensued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I beheld the ruthless power subdued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all unable now to twang the string,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mount the breeze on many-colour'd wing.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span><span class="i0">But never tawny monarch of the wood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor thunder-clouds, when winds the signal blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With louder shock astound the world below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the red flash, insufferably bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven, earth, and sea displays in dismal light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could match the furious speed and fell intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the wing&egrave;d son of Venus bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fatal yew against the dauntless fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seem'd with heart of proof to meet the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Etna sends abroad the blast of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, wrapp'd in flames, the giant moves beneath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Scylla, roaring, nor the loud reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mad Charybdis, when her waters fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seem to lave the moon, could match the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those fierce rivals burning to engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloof the many drew with sudden fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clamber'd up the hills to see the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the tempest of the battle grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each face display'd a wan and earthy hue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The assailant now prepared his shaft to wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed his fatal arrow on the string:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal string already reach'd his ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor from the leopard flies the trembling deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With half the haste that his ferocious wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore him impetuous on to deeds of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his stern regard the scorching fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen, that burns the breast with fierce desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me a fatal flame! but hope to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lovely tyrant forced to love like me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, bound in equal chain, assuaged my woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, with an eager eye, I watch'd the coming blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But virtue, as it ne'er forsakes the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yields obedience to her blest control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proves how of her unjustly we complain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In vain the self-abandon'd shift the blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their stars, or fate's perverted name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er did a gladiator shun the stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nimbler turn, or more attentive look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never did pilot's hand the vessel steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more dexterity the shoals to clear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By grace and virtue arm'd in head and heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wafted quick the cruel shaft aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe to the lingering soul that dares the stroke abide!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watch'd, and long with firm expectance stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see a mortal by a god subdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The usual fate of man! in hope to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cords of Love the beauteous captive bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me, a willing slave, to Cupid's car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fortunes of the common race to share.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one, whose secrets in his looks we spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His inmost thoughts discovers in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in his aspect, graved by nature's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My gestures, ere I spoke, enforced my fond demand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, link us to your wheels!" aloud I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If your victorious arms the fray decide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, bind us closely with your strongest chain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ne'er will seek for liberty again!"&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No bard that ever quaff'd Castalia's rill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With magic plumed, and barb'd with hot desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of their sacred aim, innoxious fell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who scorns the temper'd mail and buckler's ward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her the Virtues came&mdash;an heavenly guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sky-descended legion, clad in light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glorious panoply, contemning mortal might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All weaponless they came; but hand in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defied the fury of the adverse band:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there consummate Beauty shone, combined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the pureness of an angel-mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the host that to the conflict came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bosoms kindling with empyreal flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sense of heavenly help.&mdash;The beams that broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each celestial file with horror struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bowyer god, who felt the blinding rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a mortal stood in fix'd amaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on his spoils the fair assailants flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunder'd at their ease the captive crew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some with palmy boughs the way bestrew'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show their conquest o'er the baffled god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden as Hannibal on Zama's field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was forced to Scipio's conquering arms to yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden as David's hand the giant sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Accaron beheld his fall and fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden as her revenge who gave the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her stern guards dispatch'd the Persian lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like a man that feels a strong disease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shivering members in a moment seize&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such direful throes convulsed the despot's frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands, that veil'd his eyes, confess'd his shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mental pangs, more agonising far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his sick bosom bred a civil war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hate and anguish, with insatiate ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd in his eyes with momentary fire.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not raging Ocean, when its billows boil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Typhon, when he lifts the trembling soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Arima, his tortured limbs to ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Etna, thundering o'er the subject seas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surpass'd the fury of the baffled Power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stamp'd with rage, and bann'd the luckless hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenes yet unsung demand my loftiest lays&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! the theme transcends a mortal's praise.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span><span class="i0">A sweet but humbler subject may suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To muster in my song her fair allies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first, her arms and vesture claim my song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I chant the fair attendant throng:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A robe she wore that seem'd of woven light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The buckler of Minerva fill'd her right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Medusa's bane; a column there was drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of jasper bright; and o'er the snowy lawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round her beauteous neck a chain was slung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which glittering on her snowy bosom hung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diamond and topaz there, with mingled ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return'd in varied hues the beam of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A treasure of inestimable cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too long, alas! in Lethe's bosom lost:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To modern matrons scarcely known by fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few, were it to be found, the prize would claim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this the vanquish'd god she firmly bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I with joy her kind assistance own'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! the feeble Muse attempts in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To celebrate in song her numerous train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all the choir of Aganippe's spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pageant of the sisterhood could sing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some shall live, distinguished in my lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most illustrious of the long array.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dexter wing the fair Lucretia led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, who, faithful to her nuptial bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her suitors scorn'd: and these with dauntless hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quiver seized, and scatter'd on the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pointless arrows, and the broken bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cupid, their despoil'd and recreant foe.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely Virginia with her sire was nigh:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paternal love and anger in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beam'd terrible, while in his hand he show'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft the dagger, tinged with virgin blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which freedom on the maid and Rome at once bestow'd.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Teutonic dames, a dauntless race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rush'd on death to shun a foe's embrace;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Judith chaste and fair, but void of dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the hot blood of Holofernes shed;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that fair Greek who chose a watery grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her threaten'd purity unstain'd to save.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span><span class="i0">All these and others to the combat flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all combined to wreak the vengeance due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On him, whose haughty hand in days of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From clime to clime his conquering standard bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another troop the vestal virgin led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bore along from Tyber's oozy bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His liquid treasure in a sieve, to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The falsehood of her base calumnious foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wondrous proof.&mdash;And there the Sabine queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the matrons of her race was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renown'd in records old;&mdash;and next in fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was she, who dauntless met the funeral flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wrong'd in Love, but to preserve her vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immaculate to her Sidonian spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let others of &AElig;neas' falsehood tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How by an unrequited flame she fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nobler, though a self-inflicted doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caused by connubial Love, dismiss'd her to the tomb.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picarda next I saw, who vainly tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass her days on Arno's flowery side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single purity, till force compell'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virgin to the marriage bond to yield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The triumph seem'd at last to reach the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lofty Baise hears the Tuscan roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas on a vernal morn it touch'd the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twixt Mount Barbaro that crowns the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Avernus (once an hallow'd ground);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Cum&aelig;an sibyl's cell renown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linterno's sandy bounds it reach'd at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Scipio's favour'd haunt in ages past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famed Africanus, whose victorious blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slaughterous deeds of Hannibal repaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his country's heart a bloody passage made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in a calm retreat his life he spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rural peace and solitude content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the flying rumour sped before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And magnified the deed from shore to shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pageant, when it reach'd the destined spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem'd to exceed their utmost reach of thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, all distinguish'd by their deeds of arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excell'd the rest in more than mortal charms.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor he, whom oft the steeds of conquest drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdained another's triumphs to pursue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the metropolis arrived at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fair Sulpicia's temples soon we pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred to Chastity, to ward the pest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which her sensual foes inflame the breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patroness of noble dames alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was the fair plebeian Pole unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victress here display'd her martial spoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the laurel hung that crown'd her toils:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guard she stationed on the temple's bound&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tuscan, mark'd with many a glorious wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicion in the jealous breast to cure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him a chosen squadron kept the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard their names, and I remember well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful Greek that by his stepdame fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him who, kept by Heaven's command in awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refused to violate the nuptial law.<br /></span>

<h4>PART I.</h4>

<h3><i>Questa leggiadra e gloriosa Donna.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">The</span> glorious Maid, whose soul to heaven is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the rest cold earth, she who was grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pillar of true valour, and had gain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much honour by her victory, and chain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That god which doth the world with terror bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Using no armour but her own chaste mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fair aspect, coy thoughts, and words well weigh'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet modesty to these gave friendly aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a miracle on earth to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bow and arrows of the deity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his armour broke, who erst had slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such numbers, and so many captive ta'en;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair dame from the noble sight withdrew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her choice company,&mdash;they were but few.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a little troop, true virtue's rare,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet each of them did by herself appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A theme for poems, and might well incite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best historian: they bore a white<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span><span class="i0">Unspotted ermine, in a field of green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About whose neck a topaz chain was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set in pure gold; their heavenly words and gait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Express'd them blest were born for such a fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright stars they seem'd, she did a sun appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who darken'd not the rest, but made more clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their splendour; honour in brave minds is found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This troop, with violets and roses crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheerfully march'd, when lo, I might espy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another ensign dreadful to mine eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady clothed in black, whose stern looks were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horror fill'd, and did like hell appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced, and said, "You who are proud to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair and young, yet have no eyes to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How near you are your end; behold, I am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, whom they, fierce, and blind, and cruel name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who meet untimely deaths; 'twas I did make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greece subject, and the Roman Empire shake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My piercing sword sack'd Troy, how many rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barbarous people are by me subdued?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many ambitious, vain, and amorous thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My unwish'd presence hath to nothing brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now am I come to you, while yet your state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is happy, ere you feel a harder fate."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"On these you have no power," she then replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who had more worth than all the world beside,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And little over me; but there is one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who will be deeply grieved when I am gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His happiness doth on my life depend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall find freedom in a peaceful end."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who glancing with a sudden eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some unexpected object doth espy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then looks again, and doth his own haste blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in a doubting pause, this cruel dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little stay'd, and said, "The rest I call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mind, and know I have o'ercome them all:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with less fierce aspect, she said, "Thou guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this fair crew, hast not my strength assay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her advise, who may command, prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decrepit age, 'tis but a punishment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me this honour thou alone shalt have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without or fear or pain, to find thy grave."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span><span class="i0">"As He shall please, who dwelleth in the heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rules on earth, such portion must be given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, as others from thy hand receive,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered then; afar we might perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions of dead heap'd on th' adjacent plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No verse nor prose may comprehend the slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did on Death's triumph wait, from India,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Spain, and from Morocco, from Cathay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the skirts of th' earth they gather'd were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had most happy lived, attended there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Popes, Emperors, nor Kings, no ensigns wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their past height, but naked show'd and poor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where be their riches, where their precious gems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mitres, sceptres, robes, and diadems?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O miserable men, whose hopes arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From worldly joys, yet be there few so wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in those trifling follies not to trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if they be deceived, in end 'tis just:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! more than blind, what gain you by your toil?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must return once to your mother's soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after-times your names shall hardly know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any profit from your labour grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All those strange countries by your warlike stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Submitted to a tributary yoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fuel erst of your ambitious fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What help they now? The vast and bad desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wealth and power at a bloody rate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is wicked,&mdash;better bread and water eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With peace; a wooden dish doth seldom hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poison'd draught; glass is more safe than gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for this theme a larger time will ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must betake me to my former task.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal hour of her short life drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doubtful passage which the world doth fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another company, who had not been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freed from their earthy burden there were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try if prayers could appease the wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stay th' inexorable hand, of Death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beauteous crowd convened to see the end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all must taste; each neighbour, every friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood by, when grim Death with her hand took hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pull'd away one only hair of gold,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span><span class="i0">Thus from the world this fairest flower is ta'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make her shine more bright, not out of spleen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many moaning plaints, what store of cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were utter'd there, when Fate shut those fair eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which so oft I sung; whose beauty burn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tortured heart so long; while others mourn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pleased, and quiet did the fruit enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her blest life: "Farewell," without annoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"True saint on earth," said they; so might she be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteem'd, but nothing bates Death's cruelty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall become of others, since so pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A body did such heats and colds endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed so often in so little space?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, worldly hopes, how blind you be, how base!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If since I bathe the ground with flowing tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that mild soul, who sees it, witness bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou who read'st mayst judge she fetter'd me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sixth of April, and did set me free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the same day and month. Oh! how the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fortune is unsure; none hates the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slavery, or of death, so much as I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhor the time which wrought my liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my too lasting life; it had been just<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My greater age had first been turn'd to dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paid to time, and to the world, the debt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I owed, then earth had kept her glorious state:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now at what rate I should the sorrow prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, nor have heart that can suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad affliction to relate in verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these fair dames, that wept about her hearse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Courtesy, Virtue, Beauty, all are lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall become of us? None else can boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such high perfection; no more we shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear her wise words, nor the angelical<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet music of her voice." While thus they cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parting spirit doth itself divide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every virtue from the noble breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some grave hermit seeks a lonely rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavens were clear, and all the ambient air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a threatening cloud; no adversaire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Durst once appear, or her calm mind affright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death singly did herself conclude the fight;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span><span class="i0">After, when fear, and the extremest plaint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ceased, th' attentive eyes of all were bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that fair face, and by despair became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure; she who was spent, not like a flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By force extinguish'd, but as lights decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And undiscerned waste themselves away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus went the soul in peace; so lamps are spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the oil fails which gave them nourishment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sum, her countenance you still might know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same it was, not pale, but white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which on the tops of hills in gentle flakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls in a calm, or as a man that takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desir'ed rest, as if her lovely sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were closed with sweetest sleep, after the sprite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gone. If this be that fools call to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death seem'd in her exceeding fair to be.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of that so glorious and so brief career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the dark pass so terrible to man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a fair troop of ladies gather'd there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still of this earth, with grace and honour crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mark if ever Death remorseful were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This gentle company thus throng'd around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her contemplating the awful end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All once must make, by law of nature bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each was a neighbour, each a sorrowing friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Death stretch'd forth his hand, in that dread hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her bright head a golden hair to rend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus culling of this earth the fairest flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hate impell'd the deed, but pride, to dare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gathering already virtue's guerdon high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Depart in peace, O mortal goddess pure!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whether in earth sank deep the dews of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the bright spirit that had pass'd away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think, ye who listen! they who witness'd know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas the first hour, of April the sixth day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bound me, and, alas! now sets me free:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Fortune doth her fickleness display!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None ever grieved for loss of liberty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or doom of death as I for freedom grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life prolong'd, who only ask to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due to the world it had been her to leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me, of earlier birth, to have laid low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of its pride and boast the age bereave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How great the grief it is not mine to show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce dare I think, still less by numbers try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by vain speech to ease my weight of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue is dead, beauty and courtesy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrowing dames her honour'd couch around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For what are we reserved?" in anguish cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where now in woman will all grace be found?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with her wise and gentle words be blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drink of her sweet song th' angelic sound?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit parting from that beauteous breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its meek virtues wrapt, and best prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had with serenity the heavens imprest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No power of darkness, with ill influence, dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a space so holy to intrude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Death his terrible triumph had declared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hush'd was all lament, all fear subdued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each on those beauteous features gazed intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from despair was arm'd with fortitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a pure flame that not by force is spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But faint and fainter softly dies away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass'd gently forth in peace the soul content:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a light of clear and steady ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fails the source from which its brightness flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She to the last held on her-wonted way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, was she? no, but white as shrouding snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, when the winds are lull'd, fall silently,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span><span class="i0">She seem'd as one o'erwearied to repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en as in balmy slumbers lapt to lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The spirit parted from the form below),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her appear'd what th' unwise term to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death sate beauteous on her beauteous brow.<br /></span>

<h4>PART II</h4>

<h3><i>La notte che segu&igrave; l' orribil caso.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">The</span> night&mdash;that follow'd the disastrous blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which my spent sun removed in heaven to glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left me here a blind and desolate man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now far advanced, to spread o'er earth began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet spring dew which harbingers the dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When slumber's veil and visions are withdrawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, crown'd with oriental gems, and bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As newborn day, upon my tranced sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lady lighted from her starry sphere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kind speech and soft sigh, her hand so dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long desired in vain, to mine she press'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While heavenly sweetness instant warm'd my breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Remember her, who, from the world apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept all your course since known to that young heart."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive she spoke, with mild and modest air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seating me by her, on a soft bank, where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In greenest shade, the beech and laurel met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Remember? ah! how should I e'er forget?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet tell me, idol mine," in tears I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Live you?&mdash;or dreamt I&mdash;is, is Laura dead?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Live I? I only live, but you indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are dead, and must be, till the last best hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall free you from the flesh and vile world's power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, our brief leisure lest desire exceed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn we, ere breaks the day already nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To themes of greater interest, pure and high."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I: "When ended the brief dream and vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men call life, by you now safely pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is death indeed such punishment and pain?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied she: "While on earth your lot is cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slave to the world's opinions blind and hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True happiness shall ne'er your search reward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death to the good a dreary prison opes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the vile and base, who all their hopes<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span><span class="i0">And cares below have fix'd, is full of fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this my loss, now mourn'd with many a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seem a gain, and, knew you my delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boundless and pure, your joyful praise excite."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spoke she, and on heaven her grateful eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devoutly fix'd, but while her rose-lips lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chain'd in cold silence, I renew'd my theme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lightning and storm, red battle, age, disease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Backs, prisons, poison, famine,&mdash;make not these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, even to the bravest, bitter seem?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answer'd: "I deny not that the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is great and sore which waits on parting life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then of death eternal the sharp dread!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if the soul with hope from heaven be fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haply in itself the heart have grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then is death? Its brief sigh brings relief:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already I approach'd my final goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My strength was failing, on the wing my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus a low sad-whisper by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O miserable! who, to vain life tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counts every hour and deems each hour a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By land or ocean, to himself a prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he wanders, who one form pursues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indulges one desire, one dream renews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought, speech, sense, feeling, there for ever bound!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It ceased, and to the spot whence came the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn'd my languid eyes, and her beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your love who check'd, my pity who impell'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I recognised her by that voice and air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often which had chased my spirit's gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now calm and wise, as courteous then and fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But e'en to you when dearest, in the bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joyous youth and beauty's rosy prime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theme of much thought, and muse of many a rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believe me, life to me was far less sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than thus a merciful mild death to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blessed hope, to mortals rarely given:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such joy smooth'd my path from earth to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from long exile to sweet home I turn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While but for you alone my soul with pity yearn'd."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But tell me, lady," said I, "by that true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loyal faith, on earth well known to you<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span><span class="i0">Now better known before the Omniscient's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in your breast the thought e'er found a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love prompted, my long martyrdom to cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though virtue follow'd still her fair emprize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ah! oft written in those sweetest eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear anger, dear disdain, and pardon dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long o'er my wishes doubts and shadows cast."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce from my lips the venturous speech had pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When o'er her fair face its old sun-smile beam'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sinking virtue which so oft redeem'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a tender sigh she answer'd: "Never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can or did aught from you my firm heart sever:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as, to our young fame, no other way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Direct and plain, of mutual safety lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I temper'd with cold looks your raging flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fondest mothers wayward children tame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How often have I said, 'It me behoves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To act discreetly, for he burns, not loves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hopes and fears, ill plays discretion's part!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must not in my face detect my heart;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas this, which, as a rein the generous horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slack'd your hot haste, and shaped your proper course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often, while Love my struggling heart consumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has anger tinged my cheek, my eyes illumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Love in me could reason ne'er subdue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever if I saw you sorrow-spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant my fondest looks on you were bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself from shame, from death redeeming you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if the flame of passion blazed too high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My greeting changed, with short speech and cold eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sorrow moved you or my terror shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these the arts I used, the way I took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiles varying scorn as sunshine follows rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know, and well have sung in many a deathless strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again and oft, as saw I sunk in grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those tearful eyes, I said, 'Without relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely and swift he marches to his grave,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, at the thought, the fitting help I gave.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if I saw you wild and passion spurr'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompt with the curb, your boldness I deterr'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus cold and kind, pale, blushing, gloomy, gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe have I led you through the dangerous way,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span><span class="i0">And, as my labour, great my joy at last."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling, I answer'd, and my tears flow'd fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lady, could I the blessed thought believe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My faithful love would full reward receive."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O man of little faith!"&mdash;her fairest cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en as she spoke, a warm blush 'gan to streak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why should I say it, were it less than true?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you on earth were pleasant in my view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I need not ask; enough it pleased to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best love of that true heart fix'd on me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well too your genius pleased me, and the fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, far and wide, it shower'd upon my name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Love had blame in its excess alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wanted prudence; while you sought to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By act and air, what long I knew and well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the whole world your secret heart was shown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence was the coldness which your hopes distress'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such our sympathy in all the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is alone where Love keeps honour's law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since in your bosom first its birth I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One fire our heart has equally inflamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except that I conceal'd it, you proclaim'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And louder as your cry for mercy swell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror and shame my silence more compell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men my great desire should little think;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! concealment makes not sorrow less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complaint embitters not the mind's distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling with fiction cannot swell and shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But surely then at least the veil was raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You only present when your verse I praised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispering sang, 'Love dares not more to say.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yours was my heart, though turn'd my eyes away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieve you, as cruel, that their grace was such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As kept the little, gave the good and much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet oft and openly as they withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far oftener furtively they dwelt on you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pity thus, what prudence robb'd, return'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever so their tranquil lights had burn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that I fear'd those dear and dangerous eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might then the secret of my soul surprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one thing more, that, ere our parley cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory may shrine my words, as treasures sweet,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span><span class="i0">And this our parting give your spirit peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all things else my fortune was complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this alone some cause had I to mourn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That first I saw the light in humble earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still, in sooth, it grieves that I was born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the flowery nest where you had birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fair to me the land where your love bless'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply that heart, which I alone possess'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere had others loved, myself unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, now voiced by fame, had there inglorious been."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, no!" I cried, "howe'er the spheres might roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever born, immutable and whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life, in death, my great love had been yours."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Enough," she smiled, "its fame for aye endures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my own! but pleasure has such power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too little have we reck'd the growing hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! Aurora, from her golden bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings back the day to mortals, and the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already from the ocean lifts his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! he warns me that, my mission done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We here must part. If more remain to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet friend! in speech be brief, as must my stay."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I: "This kindest converse makes to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sense of my long suffering light and sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lady! for that now my life must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hateful and heavy, tell me, I entreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, late or early, we again shall meet?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If right I read the future, long must you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without me walk the earth."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke, and pass'd from view.<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">When</span> cruel Death his paly ensign spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over that face, which oft in triumph led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My subject thoughts; and beauty's sovereign light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring, left the world immersed in night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Phantom, with a frown that chill'd the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem'd with his gloomy pageant to depart,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span><span class="i0">Exulting in his formidable arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proud of conquest o'er seraphic charms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, turning round, I saw the Power advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breaks the gloomy grave's eternal trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids the disembodied spirit claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious guerdon of immortal Fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Phosphor, in the sullen rear of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the golden wheels of orient light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came. But who the tendant pomp can tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mighty master of the corded shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can sing how heaven above accordant smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what bright pageantry the prospect fill'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look'd, but all in vain: the potent ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd on my sight intolerable day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first; but to the splendour soon inured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eyes perused the pomp with sight assured.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True dignity in every face was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on they march'd with more than mortal mien;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some I saw whom Love had link'd before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ennobled now by Virtue's lofty lore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&aelig;sar and Scipio on the dexter hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the bright goddess led the laurell'd band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, like a planet by the lord of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem'd o'er-illumined by her splendid ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By brightness hid; for he, to virtue true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind from Love's soft bondage nobly drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other, half a slave to female charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parted his homage to the god of arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Love's seductive power: but, close and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like files that climb'd the Capitolian steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In years of yore, along the sacred way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A martial squadron came in long array.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ranges as they moved distinct and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every burganet that met the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some name of long renown, distinctly read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er each majestic brow a glory shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still on the noble pair my eyes I bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watch'd their progress up the steep ascent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second Scipio next in line was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that seem'd the lure of Egypt's queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a mighty chief I there beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose valorous hand the battle's storm repell'd.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span><span class="i0">Two fathers of the great Cornelian name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their three noble sons who shared their fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One singly march'd before, and, hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His two heroic partners trod the strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last was first in fame; but brighter beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His follower flung around in solar streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Metaurus' champion, whom the moon beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his resistless spears the current swell'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Libya's hated gore, in arms renown'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he, nor less with Wisdom's olive crown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick was his thought and ready was his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His power accomplish'd what his reason plann'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seem'd, with eagle eye and eagle wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden on his predestined game to spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he that follow'd next with step sedate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew round his foe the viewless snare of fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, with consummate art, he kept at bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raging foe, and conquer'd by delay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another Fabius join'd the stoic pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pauli and Marcelli famed in war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them the victor in the friendly strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose public virtue quench'd his love of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With either Brutus ancient Curius came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fabricius, too, I spied, a nobler name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(With his plain russet gown and simple board)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than either Lydian with her golden hoard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the great dictator from the plough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Serranus show'd his laurell'd brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marching with equal step. Camillus near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, fresh and vigorous in the bright career<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of honour, sped, and never slack'd his pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Death o'ertook him in the noble race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed him in a sphere of fame so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other patriots fill'd a lower sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even those ungrateful lands that seal'd his doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recall'd the hanish'd man to rescue Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torquains nigh, a sterner spectre stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fasces all besmear'd with filial blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He childless to the shades resolved to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than Rome a moment should forego<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dreadful discipline, whose rigid lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had spread their triumphs round from shore to shore.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span><span class="i0">Then the two Decii came, by Heaven inspired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divinely bold, as when the foe retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their Heaven-directed march, amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the self-devoted men they gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they provoked their fate. And Curtius nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when to heaven he cast his upward eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all on fire with glory's opening charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged to the Shades below with clanging arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">L&aelig;vinus, Mummius, with Flaminius show'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like meaner lights along the heavenly road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who conquer'd Greece from sea to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mildly bade th' afflicted race be free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next came the dauntless envoy, with his wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose more than magic circle on the sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frenzy of the Syrian king confined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-awed he stood, and at his fate repined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Manlius, too, who drove the hostile throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone from the steep on which his members hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A sad reverse) the hungry vultures' food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Roman justice claim'd his forfeit blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Cocles came, who took his dreadful stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the wide arch the foaming torrent spann'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stemming the tide of war with matchless might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn'd the heady current of the fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that, stung with fierce vindictive ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consumed his erring hand with hostile fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duillius next and Catulus were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose daring navies plough'd the billowy green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That laves Pelorus and the Sardian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dyed the rolling waves with Punic gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Appius next advanced in sterner mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with patrician loftiness withstood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clamours of the crowd. But, close behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gentler manners and more equal mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came one, perhaps the first in martial might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet his dim glory cast a waning light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither Bacchus, nor Alcmena's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such trophies yet by east or west have won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor he that in the arms of conquest died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he, when Rome's stern foes his valour tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he survived his fame. But luckier far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was one that follow'd next, whose golden star<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span><span class="i0">To better fortune led, and mark'd his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the first in deeds of martial fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cruel was his rage, and dipp'd in gore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By civil slaughter was the wreath he wore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A less-ensanguined laurel graced the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him that next advanced with lofty tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In martial conduct and in active might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of equal honour in the fields of fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then great Volumnius, who expell'd the pest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose spreading ills the Romans long distress'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutilius Cassus, Philo next in sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear'd, like twinkling stars that gild the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three men I saw advancing up the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dentatus, long in standing fight renown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sergius and Sc&aelig;va oft with conquest crown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The triple terror of the hostile train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whom the storm of battle broke in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another Sergius near with deep disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marr'd the long glories of his ancient race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marius, then, the Cimbrians who repell'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fearful Rome, and Lybia's tyrant quell'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fulvius, who Campania's traitors slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paid ingratitude with vengeance due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another nobler Fulvius next appear'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the Father of the Gracchi rear'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solitary crest. The following form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he that often raised the factious storm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold Catulus, and he whom fortune's ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumined still with beams of cloudless day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fail'd to chase the darkness of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brooded still on loftier hopes behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him a nobler line in two degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reduced Numidia to reluctant peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crete, Spain, and Macedonia's conquer'd lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorn'd their triumphs and their treasures stored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vespasian, with his son, I next survey'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel soul in angel form array'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less his brother seem'd in outward grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hell within belied a beauteous face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Nerva, who retrieved the falling throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Trajan, by his conquering eagles known.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span><span class="i0">Adrian, and Antonine the just and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, with his son, the golden age renew'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere they ruled the world, themselves subdued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as I turn'd my roving eyes around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quirinus I beheld with laurel crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And five succeeding kings. The sixth was lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By vice degraded from his regal post;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sentence just, whatever pride may claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For virtue only finds eternal Fame.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Full</span> of ecstatic wonder at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I view'd Bellona's minions, famed in fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brotherhood, to whom the circling sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No rivals yet beheld, since time begun.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! the Muse despairs to mount their fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the plaudits of historic Fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now a foreign band the strain recalls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern Hannibal, that shook the Roman walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles, famed in Homer's lasting lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan pair that kept their foes at bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Susa's proud rulers, a distinguish'd pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that pour'd the living storm of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fallen thrones of Asia, till the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With awful voice, repell'd the conquering train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another chief appear'd, alike in name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But short was his career of martial fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For generous valour oft to fortune yields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too oft the arbitress of fighting fields.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three illustrious Thebans join'd the train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose noble names adorn a former strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Ajax with Tydides next appear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that o'er the sea's broad bosom steer'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of shores unknown with daring prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ancient Nestor, with his looks of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thrice beheld the race of man decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hail'd as oft a new heroic line:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Agamemnon, with the Spartan's shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One by his spouse forsaken, one betray'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now another Spartan met my view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, cheerly, call'd his self-devoted crew<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span><span class="i0">To banquet with the ghostly train below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with unfading laurels deck'd the brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though from a bounded stage a softer strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his, who next appear'd to cross the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famed Alcibiades, whose siren spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could raise the tide of passion, or repel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more than magic sounds, when Athens stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his superior eloquence subdued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Marathonian chief, with conquest crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cimon came, for filial love renown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who chose the dungeon's gloom and galling chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His captive father's liberty to gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themistocles and Theseus met my eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that with the first of Rome could vie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In self-denial; yet their native soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insensate to their long illustrious toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each denied the honours of a tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But deathless fame reversed the rigid doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show'd their worth in more conspicuous light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the surrounding shades of envious night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Phocion next, who mourn'd an equal fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expell'd and exiled from his parent state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foul reward! by party rage decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For acts that well might claim a nobler meed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Pyrrhus, with Numidia's king behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever in faithful league with Rome combined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bulwark of his state. Another nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Syracuse, I saw, a firm ally<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Italy, like him. But deadly hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repulsive frowns, and love of stern debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hamilcar mark'd, who at a distance stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyed the friendly pair in hostile mood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal Lydian, with distracted mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as he 'scaped the vengeful flame, was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Syphax, who deplored an equal doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who paid with life his enmity of Rome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brennus, famed for sacrilegious spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, overwhelm'd beneath the rocky pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atoned the carnage of his cruel hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join'd the long pageant of the martial band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who march'd in foreign or barbarian guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every realm and clime beneath the skies<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span><span class="i0">But different far in habit from the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tribe with reverent awe my heart impress'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he that entertain'd the grand design<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build a temple to the Power Divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him, to whom the oracles of Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The task to raise the sacred pile had given:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The task he soon fulfill'd by Heaven assign'd,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let the nobler temple of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ruin fall, by Love's alluring sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seduced from duty's hallow'd path astray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he that on the flaming hill survived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sight no mortal else beheld, and lived&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Eternal One, and heard, with awe profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That awful voice that shakes the globe around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him who check'd the sun in mid career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stopp'd the burning wheels that mark the sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As a well-managed steed his lord obeys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the straiten'd rein his course delays,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the flying war the tide of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued, and show'd their bands in wild dismay.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victorious faith! to thee belongs the prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In earth thy power is felt, and in the circling skies.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father next, who erst by Heaven's command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook his home, and sought the promised land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hallow'd scene of wide-redeeming grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the care of Heaven consign'd his race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Jacob, cheated in his amorous vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who led in either hand a Syrian spouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youthful Joseph, famed for self-command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen, conspicuous midst his kindred band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretching far my sight amid the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hid, in countless crowds, the shaded plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Hezekiah met my raptured sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Manoah's son, a prey to female sleight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, whose eye foresaw the coming flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mighty Nimrod nigh, a man of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pride the heaven-defying tower design'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sin the rising fabric undermined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Maccabeus next my notice claim'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Love to Zion's broken laws inflamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rush'd to arms to save a sinking state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning the menace of impending Fate<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span><span class="i0">Now satiate with the view, my languid sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fail'd, but soon perceived with new delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A train, like Heaven's descending powers, appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose radiance seem'd my cherish'd sight to clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There march'd in rank the dames of ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antiope, renown'd for martial praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orithya near, in glittering armour shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair Hippolyta that wept her son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sisters whom Alcides met of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arms on Thermodon's distinguish'd shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he and Theseus foil'd the warlike pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By force compell'd the nuptial rite to share.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The widow'd queen, who seem'd with tranquil smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view her son upon the funeral pile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brooding vengeance rankled deep within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Cyrus fell within the fatal gin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misconduct, which from age to age convey'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er her long glories cast a funeral shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the Amazon whom Ilion mourn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her for whom the flames of discord burn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the Trojan and Rutulian train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her affianced lover press'd the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her, that with dishevell'd tresses flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-arm'd, half-clad, her rebels to subdue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her partner too in lawless love I spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Roman harlot, an incestuous bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Tadmor's queen, with nobler fires inflamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pristine glory of the sex reclaim'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in the spring of life, in beauty's bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart devoted to her husband's tomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True to his dust, aspiring to the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of virtue, in such years but seldom known:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With temper'd mail she hid her snowy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with Bellona's helm and nodding crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despising Cupid's lore, her charms conceal'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led the foes of Latium to the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shock at ancient Rome was felt afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tyber trembled at the distant war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of foes she held in scorn: but soon she found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Mars his native tribes with conquest crown'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by her haughty foes in triumph led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last warm tears of indignation shed.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span><span class="i0">O fair Bethulian! can my vagrant song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erpass thy virtues in the nameless throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he that sought to lure thee to thy shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid with his sever'd head his frantic flame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can Ninus be forgot, whose ancient name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins the long roll of imperial fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he whose pride, by Heaven's imperial doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reduced among the grazing herd to roam?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belus, who first beheld the nations sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To idols, from the Heaven-directed way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he was blameless? Where does he reside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first the dangerous art of magic tried?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Crassus! much I mourn the baleful star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That o'er Euphrates led the storm of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy troops, by Parthian snares encircled round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark'd with Hesperia's shame the bloody ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mithridates, Rome's incessant foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fled through burning plains and tracts of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fell pursuit. But now, the parting strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must pass, with slight survey, the coming train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There British Arthur seeks his share of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three C&aelig;sarian victors join their claim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One from the race of Libya, one from Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, not least, the pride of fair Lorraine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his twelve noble peers. Goffredo's powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Direct their march to Salem's sacred towers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant his throne beneath the Asian skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred seat that now neglected lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye lords of Christendom! eternal shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever will pursue each royal name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell your wolfish rage for kindred blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Paynim hounds profane the seat of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him the Christian glory seem'd to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest was hid behind oblivion's pall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save a few honour'd names, inferior far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace to guide, or point the storm of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet e'en among the stranger tribes were found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few selected names, in song renown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, mighty Saladin, his country's boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scourge and terror of the baptized host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noradin, and Lancaster fierce in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who vex'd the Gallic coast with long alarms.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span><span class="i0">I look'd around with painful search to spy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any martial form should meet my eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar to my sight in worlds above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The willing objects of respect or love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon a well-known face my notice drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sicilia's king, to whose sagacious view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scenes of deep futurity display'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their birth, through coming Time's disclosing shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There my Colonna, too, with glad surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid the pale group, assail'd my startled eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His noble soul was all alive to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet holy friendship mix'd her softer claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in his bosom fix'd her lasting throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Charity, that makes the wants of all her own.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose toils deserve a more exalted strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plato majestic in the front appear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wisdom's sacred hand her ensign rear'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial blazonry! by heaven bestow'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From ancient Argos to the Phrygian bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His never-dying strains were borne around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On inspiration's wing, and hill and dale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed the notes of Ilion's mournful tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woes of Thetis, and Ulysses' toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mighty mind recover'd from the spoils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of envious time, and placed in lasting light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trophies ransom'd from oblivion's night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mantuan bard, responsive to his song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Co-rival of his glory, walk'd along.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span><span class="i0">The next with new surprise my notice drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he pass'd spontaneous flowerets grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit emblems of his style; and close behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Athenian at his lot repined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which doom'd him, like a secondary star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To yield precedence in the wordy war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though like the bolts of Jove that shake the spheres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lighten'd in their eyes, and thunder'd in their ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The assembly felt the shock, the immortal sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Attic rival's fainter accents drown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now so many candidates for fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In countless crowds and gay confusion came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Memory seem'd her province to resign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perplex'd and lost amid the lengthen'd line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Solon there I spied, for laws renown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salubrious plants in clean and cultured ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But noxious, if malignant hands infuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their transmuted stems a baneful juice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst the Romans, Varro next I spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light of linguists, and our country's pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still nearer as he moved, the eye could trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new attraction and a nameless grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Livy I saw, with dark invidious frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening with pain to Sallust's loud renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pliny there, profuse of life I found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom love of knowledge to the burning bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led unawares; and there Plotinus' shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dark Platonic truths in fuller light display'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, flying far to 'scape the coming pest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was, when he seem'd secure, by death oppressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, fix'd by fate, before he saw the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The careful sophist strove in vain to shun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hortensius, Crassus, Galba, next appear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calvus and Antony, by Rome revered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first with Pollio join'd, whose tongue profane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assail'd the fame of Cicero in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thucydides, who mark'd distinct and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tardy round of many a bloody year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with a master's graphic skill, pourtray'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields, "whose summer dust with blood was laid;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near Herodotus his ninefold roll display'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father of history; and Euclid's vest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heaven-taught symbols of that art express'd<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span><span class="i0">That measures matter, form, and empty space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calculates the planets' heavenly race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Porphyry, whose proud obdurate heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was proof to mighty Truth's celestial dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sophistry assail'd the cause of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood in arms against the heavenly code.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippocrates, for healing arts renown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half obscured within the dark profound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pair, whom ignorance in ancient days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorn'd like deities, with borrow'd rays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Galen was near, of Pergamus the boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose skill retrieved the art so nearly lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Anaxarchus came, who conquer'd pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, whom pleasures strove to lure in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From duty's path. And first in mournful mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty soul of Archimedes stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sage Democritus I there beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose daring hand the light of vision quell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun the soul-seducing forms, that play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the rapt fancy in the beam of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gifts of fortune, too, he flung aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wisdom's wealth, a nobler store, supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Hippias, too, I saw, who dared to claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For general science an unequall'd name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him, whose doubtful mind and roving eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No certainty in truth itself could spy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him who in a deep mysterious guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heavenly charms conceal'd from vulgar eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frontless cynic next in rank I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sworn foe to decency and nature's modest law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him the sage, that mark'd, with dark disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wealth consumed by rapine's lawless train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad that nothing now remain'd behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To foster envy in a rival's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That treasure bought, which nothing can destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The soul's calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then curious Dicaearchus met my view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who studied nature with sagacious view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quintilian next, and Seneca were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Chaeronea's sage, of placid mien;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All various in their taste and studious toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each adorn'd with Learning's splendid spoils.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span><span class="i0">There, too, I saw, in universal jar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tribes that spend their time in wordy war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the vast interminable deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of knowledge, like conflicting tempests, sweep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For truth they never toil, but feed their pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fuel by eternal strife supplied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dragon of the wild with equal rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lions in nocturnal war, engage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hate so deadly, as the learn'd and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who scan their own desert with partial eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carneades, renown'd for logic skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who right or wrong, and true and false, at will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could turn and change, employ'd his fruitless pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reconcile the fierce, contending train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ever as he toil'd, the raging pest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pride, as knowledge grew, with equal speed increased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Epicurus, of sinister fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebellious to the lord of nature, came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who studied to deprive the soaring soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her bright world of hope beyond the pole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mole-ey'd race their hapless guide pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blindly still the vain assault renew'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark Metrodorus next sustain'd the cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Aristippus, true to Pleasure's laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chrysippus next his subtle web disposed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zeno alternate spread his hand, and closed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show how eloquence expands the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And logic boasts a close and nervous whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there Cleanthes drew the mighty line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That led his pupils on, with heart divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through time's fallacious joys, by Virtue's road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the bright palace of the sovereign good.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the weary Muse forsakes the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too numerous for the bounds of mortal song.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Behind</span> Aurora's wheels the rising sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voyage from his golden shrine begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such ethereal speed, as if the Hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had caught him slumb'ring in her rosy bowers.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span><span class="i0">With lordly eye, that reach'd the world's extreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought he look'd, when, gliding on his beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wing&egrave;d power approach'd that wheels his car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its wide annual range from star to star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measuring vicissitude; till, now more near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought these thrilling accents met my ear:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"New laws must be observed if mortals claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spite of the lapse of time, eternal fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those laws have lost their force that Heaven decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I my circle run with fruitless speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fame's loud breath the slumb'ring dust inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid to live with never-dying fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My power, that measures mortal things, is cross'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my long glories in oblivion lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If mortals on yon planet's shadowy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can match the tenor of my heavenly race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I strive with fruitless speed from year to year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep precedence o'er a lower sphere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain yon flaming coursers I prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the watery world and ambient air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vigour feeds, if thus, with angels' flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal can o'ertake the race of light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were you a lesser planet, doom'd to run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shorter journey round a nobler sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranging among yon dusky orbs below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A more degrading doom I could not know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now spread your swiftest wings, my steeds of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must not yield to man's ambitious aim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With emulation's noblest fires I glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon that reptile race that boast below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright Fame's conducting lamp, that seems to vie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my incessant journeys round the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gains, or seems to gain, increasing light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall its glories sink in gradual night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am still the same; my course began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before that dusky orb, the seat of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was built in ambient air: with constant sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lead the grateful change of night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one ethereal track for ever bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever treading one eternal round."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, methought, with more than mortal ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seem'd to lash along his steeds of fire;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span><span class="i0">And shot along the air with glancing ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as a falcon darting on its prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No planet's swift career could match his speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seem'd the power of fancy to exceed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courier of the sky I mark'd with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by degrees the baseless fabric fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That human power had built, while high disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt within to see the toiling train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striving to seize each transitory thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fleets away on dissolution's wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soonest from the firmest grasp recede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like airy forms, with tantalizing speed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mortals! ere the vital powers decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or palsied eld obscures the mental ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raise your affections to the things above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which time or fickle chance can never move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had you but seen what I despair to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fast his courser plied the flaming wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unremitted speed, the soaring mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had left his low terrestrial cares behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what an awful change of earth and sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in a moment pass'd before my eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rigid winter stretch'd her brumal reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With frown Gorgonean over land and main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Flora now her gaudy mantle spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a blushing rose adorn'd her bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The momentary seasons seem'd to fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bright solstitial dews to winter's driving sleet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In circle multiform, and swift career:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous tale, untold to mortal ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before: yet reason's calm unbiass'd view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must soon pronounce the seeming fable true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When deep remorse for many a wasted spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still haunts the frighted soul on demon wing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond hope allured me on with meteor flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Love my fancy fed with vain delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chasing through fairy fields her pageants gay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, at last, a clear and steady ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From reason's mirror sent, my folly shows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on my sight the hideous image throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what I am&mdash;a mind eclipsed and lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By vice degraded from its noble post<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span><span class="i0">But yet, e'en yet, the mind's elastic spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buoys up my powers on resolution's wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on the flight of time, with rueful gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent, I try to thread the backward maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And husband what remains, a scanty space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few fleeting hours, alas! have pass'd away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since a weak infant in the lap I lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is human life but one uncertain day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hid by flying vapours, dark and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brighten'd now with gleams of sunny gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mock the gazer's eye with gaudy show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the victim to substantial woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hope can live beneath the stormy sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empty pleasures have their pinions ply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frantic pride exalts the lofty brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor marks the snares of death that lurk below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain, whether now the shaft of fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings on the wind, or heaven prolongs my date.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see my hours run on with cruel speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my doom the fate of all I read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain doom, which nature's self must feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dread sentence checks the mundane wheel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go! court the smiles of Hope, ye thoughtless crew!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fairy scenes disclose an ample view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To brainless men. But Wisdom o'er the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casts her keen glance, and lifts her beamy shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the point of Fate, that flies afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with stern vigilance expects the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps in vain my admonitions fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still the Muse repeats the solemn call;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can she see unmoved your senses drown'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Circe's deadly spells in sleep profound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cannot see the flying seasons roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dread succession to the final goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweep the tribes of men so fast away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Stygian darkness or eternal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unconcern.&mdash;Oh! yet the doom repeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before your callous hearts forget to feel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'er Penitence foregoes her fruitless toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hell's black regent claims his human spoil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, haste! before the fatal arrows fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That send you headlong to the nether sky<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span><span class="i0">When down the gulf the sons of folly go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sad procession to the seat of woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus deeply musing on the rapid round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of planetary speed, in thought profound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood, and long bewail'd my wasted hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My vain afflictions, and my squander'd powers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, in deliberate march, a train was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silent order moving o'er the green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A band that seem'd to hold in high disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desolating power of Time's resistless reign:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their names were hallow'd in the Muse's song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafted by fame from age to age along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er oblivion's deep, devouring wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where millions find an unrefunding grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envious glance the changeful power beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious phalanx which his power repell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faster now the fiery chariot flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Fame appear'd the rapid flight to rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labour'd some to save. But, close behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a voice, which, like the western wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whispers softly through the summer shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These solemn accents to mine ear convey'd:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Man is a falling flower; and Fame in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strives to protract his momentaneous reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond his bounds, to match the rolling tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whose dread waves the long olympiads ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, fed by time, the deep procession grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in long centuries continuous flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what the power of ages can oppose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Tempe's rolling flood, or Hebrus claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renown, they soon shall live an empty name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where are their heroes now, and those who led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The files of war by Xanthus' gory bed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Tuscan Tyber's more illustrious band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose conquering eagles flew o'er sea and land?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is renown?&mdash;a gleam of transient light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soon an envious cloud involves in night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While passing Time's malignant hands diffuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On many a noble name pernicious dews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus our terrestrial glories fade away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our triumphs pass the pageants of a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fields exchange their lords, our kingdoms fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrones are wrapt in Hades' funeral pall<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet virtue seldom gains what vice had lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft the hopes of good desert are cross'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wealth alone, but mental stores decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the gifts of Mammon, pass away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wisdom, wealth, nor fortune can withstand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His desolating march by sea and land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor prayers, nor regal power his wheels restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he has ground us down to dust again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though various are the titles men can plead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some for a time enjoy the glorious meed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That merit claims; yet unrelenting fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all the doom pronounces soon or late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whatsoe'er the vulgar think or say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were not your lives thus shorten'd to a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your eyes would see the consummating power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His countless millions at a meal devour."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reason's voice my stubborn mind subdued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conviction soon the solemn words pursued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw all mortal glory pass away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like vernal snows beneath the rising ray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wealth, and power, and honour, strive in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To 'scape the laws of Time's despotic reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though still to vulgar eyes they seem to claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lot conspicuous in the lists of Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transient as human joys; to feeble age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They love to linger on this earthly stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think it cruel to be call'd away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the faint morn of life's disastrous day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ah! how many infants on the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Heaven's indulgence sink to endless rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft decrepid age his lot bewails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom every ill of lengthen'd life assails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence sick despondence thinks the human lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gift of fleeting breath too dearly bought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But should the voice of Fame's obstreperous blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ages on to future ages last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to the trump of doom,&mdash;how poor the prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose worth depends upon the changing skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time bestows and claims (the fleeting breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Fame) is but, at best, a second death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A death that none of mortal race can shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wastes the brood of time, and triumphs o'er the sun.<br /></span>

<h2>THE TRIUMPH OF ETERNITY.</h2>

<h3><i>Da poi che sotto 'l ciel cosa non vidi.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">When</span> all beneath the ample cope of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, like clouds before the tempest driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sad vicissitude's eternal round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile I stood in holy horror bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus at last with self-exploring mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing, I ask'd, "What basis I could find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fix my trust?" An inward voice replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Trust to the Almighty: He thy steps shall guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never fails to hear the faithful prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But worldly hope must end in dark despair."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, what I am, and what I was, I know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the seasons in procession go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With still increasing speed; while things to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown, unthought, amid the growing gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of long futurity, perplex my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While life is posting to its final goal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine is the crime, who ought with clearer light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the winged years' incessant flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to slumber on in dull delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till circling seasons bring the doomful day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But grace is never slow in that, I trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wake the mind, before I sink to dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those strong energies that lift the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scenes unhoped, unthought, above the pole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus I ponder'd, soon my working thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more that ever-changing picture brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sublunary things before my view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus I question'd with myself anew:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is the end of this incessant flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life and death, alternate day and night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When will the motion on these orbs impress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink on the bosom of eternal rest?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once, as if obsequious to my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another prospect shone, unmoved and still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal as the heavens that glow'd above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wide resplendent scene of light and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wheels of Ph&oelig;bus from the zodiac turn'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the nightly constellations burn'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green earth and undulating ocean roll'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away, by some resistless power controll'd;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span><span class="i0">Immensity conceived, and brought to birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grander firmament, and more luxuriant earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wonder seized my soul when first I view'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How motionless the restless racer stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose flying feet, with winged speed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still mark'd with sad mutation sea and shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more he sway'd the future and the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the moveless present fix'd at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As at a goal reposing from his toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like earth unclothed of all its vernal foils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unvaried scene! where neither change nor fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor care, nor sorrow, can our joys abate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor finds the light of thought resistance here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than the sunbeams in a crystal sphere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no material things can match their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In speed excelling far the race of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! what a glorious lot shall then be mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Heaven to me these nameless joys assign!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there the sovereign good for ever reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor evil yet to come, nor present pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No baleful birth of time its inmates fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes, the burthen of the passing year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No solar chariot circles through the signs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now too near, and now too distant, shines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wretched man and earth's devoted soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispensing sad variety of toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! happy are the blessed souls that sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud hallelujahs in eternal ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice happy he, who late, at last shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lot in the celestial climes assign'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, led by grace, the auspicious ford explores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, cross the plains, the wintry torrent roars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That troublous tide, where, with incessant strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weak mortals struggle through, and call it life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In love with Vanity, oh, doubly blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are they that final consolation find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In things that fleet on dissolution's wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dance away upon the transient ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seasons, as they roll. No sound they hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that still voice that Wisdom's sons revere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No vestment they procure to keep them warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the menace of the wintry storm;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span><span class="i0">But all exposed, in naked nature lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shivering crowd beneath the inclement sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of reason void, by every foe subdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-ruin'd, self-deprived of sovereign good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless of Him, whose universal sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matter, and all its various forms, obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they mix in elemental strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or meet in married calm, and foster life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nature baffles all created mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In earth or heaven, to fathom, or to find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One glimpse of glory on the saints bestow'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eager longings fills the courts of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For deeper views, in that abyss of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While mortals slumber here, content with night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought, we find, below the moon, can fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boundless cravings of the human will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, what fierce desire the fancy wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain a grasp of perishable things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although one fleeting hour may scatter far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruit of many a year's corroding care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those spacious regions where our fancies roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain'd by the past, expecting ills to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some dread moment, by the fates assign'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall pass away, nor leave a rack behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Time's revolving wheels shall lose at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speed that spins the future and the past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sovereign of an undisputed throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awful eternity shall reign alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then every darksome veil shall fleet away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hides the prospects of eternal day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those cloud-born objects of our hopes and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose air-drawn forms deluded memory bears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of substantial things, away so fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fleet, that mortals, at their speed aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the change of all beneath the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ask, what once they were, and will be soon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time will come when every change shall cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This quick revolving wheel shall rest in peace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No summer then shall glow, nor winter freeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing shall be to come, and nothing past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an eternal now shall ever last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though time shall be no more, yet space shall give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nobler theatre to love and live<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span><span class="i0">The wing&egrave;d courier then no more shall claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power to sink or raise the notes of Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or give its glories to the noontide ray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True merit then, in everlasting day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall shine for ever, as at first it shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once to God and man and angels known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy are they who in this changing sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already have begun the bright career<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That reaches to the goal which, all in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muse would blazon in her feeble strain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But blest above all other blest is he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from the trammels of mortality,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere half the vital thread ran out, was free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mature for Heaven; where now the matchless fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserves those features, that seraphic air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those mental charms that raised my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To judge of heaven while yet on earth confined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soft attractive glance that won my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first my bosom felt unusual smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now beams, now glories, in the realms above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed by the eternal source of light and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall I see her as I first beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lovelier far, and by herself excell'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I distinguish'd in the bands above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear this plaudit in the choirs of love:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo! this is he who sung in mournful strains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years a lover's doubts and pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in this soul-expanding, sweet employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred transport felt above all vulgar joy."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too shall wonder at herself to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her praises ring around the radiant sphere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of that hour it is not mine to know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her, perhaps, the period of my woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is manifest; for she my fate may find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pure mirror of the eternal mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me it seems at hand a sure presage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denotes my rise from this terrestrial stage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then what I gain'd and lost below shall lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspended in the balance of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all our anxious sublunary cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall seem one tissue of Arachne's snares;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span><span class="i0">And all the lying vanities of life,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From the dark dungeon of the human breast<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In honour multiplied&mdash;a dreadful show<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eternal reason then shall give her doom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sever'd wide, the tenants of the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall seek their portions with instinctive haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick as the savage speeds along the waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the golden hoard its trust betray,<br /></span>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Before the publication of De Sade's "M&eacute;moires pour la vie
de Petrarque" the report was that Petrarch first saw Laura at Vaucluse.
The truth of their first meeting in the church of St. Clara depends on
the authenticity of the famous note on the M.S. Virgil of Petrarch,
which is now in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Petrarch, in his dialogue with St. Augustine, states that
he was older than Laura by a few years.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> "The Floral games were instituted in France in 1324. They
were founded by Clementina Isaure, Countess of Toulouse, and annually
celebrated in the month of May. The Countess published an edict, which
assembled all the poets of France, in artificial arbours, dressed with
flowers; and he that produced the best poem was rewared with a violet of
gold. There were, likewise, inferior prizes of flowers made in silver.
In the meantime, the conquerors were crowned with natural chaplets of
their own respective flowers. During the ceremony degrees were also
conferred. He who had won a prize three times was pronounced a doctor
'<i>en gaye science</i>,' the name of the poetry of the Proven&ccedil;al
Troubadours. This institution, however fantastic, soon became common,
through the whole of France."&mdash;<i>Warton's History of English Poetry</i>, vol
i. p 467.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> I have transferred the following anecdote from Levati's
Viaggi di Petrarea (vol. i. p. 119 et seq.). It behoves me to confess,
however, that I recollect no allusion to it in any of Petrarch's
letters, and I have found many things in Levati's book which make me
distrust his authority.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Dated 21st December. 1335.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Guido Sette of Luni, in the Genoese territory, studied law
together with Petrarch; but took to it with better liking. He devoted
himself to the business of the bar at Avignon with much reputation. But
the legal and clerical professions were then often united; for Guido
rose in the church to be an archbishop. He died in 1368, renowned as a
church luminary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Valery, in his "Travels in Italy" gives the following note
respecting out poet. I quote from the edition of the work published at
Brussels in 1835:&mdash;"Petrarque rapporte dans ses lettres latines que le
laurier du Capitole lui avait attir&eacute; une multitude d'envieux; que le
jour de son couronnement, au lieu d'eau odorante qu'il &eacute;tait d'usage de
r&eacute;pandre dans ces solennit&eacute;s, il re&ccedil;ut sur la t&ecirc;te une eau corrosive,
qui le rendit chauve le reste de sa vie. Son historien Dolce raconte
m&ecirc;me qu'une vieille lui jetta son pot de chambre rempli d'une acre
urine, gard&eacute;e, peut-&ecirc;tre, pour cela depuis sept semaines."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> <i>Translation.</i>&mdash;In the twenty-fifth year of his age, after
a short though happy existence, our John departed this life in the year
of Christ 1361, on the 10th of July, or rather on the 9th, at the
midhour between Friday and Saturday. Sent into the world to my
mortification and suffering, he was to me in life the cause of deep and
unceasing solicitude, and in death of poignant grief. The news reached
me on the evening of the 13th of the same month that he had fallen at
Milan, in the general mortality caused by that unwonted scourge which at
last discovered and visited so fearfully this hitherto exempted city. On
the 8th of August, the same year, a servant of mine returning from Milan
brought me a rumour (which on the 18th of the same fatal month was
confirmed by a servant of <i>Dominus Theatinus</i>) of the death of my
Socrates, my companion, my best of brothers, at Babylon (Avignon, I
mean) in the month of May. I have lost my comrade and the solace of my
life! Receive, Christ Jesus, these two, and the five that remain, into
thy eternal habitations!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> Petrarch's words are: "civi servare suo;" but he takes the
liberty of considering Charles as&mdash;adoptively&mdash;Italian, though that
Prince was born at Prague.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> Most historians relate that the English, at Poitiers,
amounted to no more than eight or ten thousand men; but, whether they
consisted of eight thousand or thirty thousand, the result was
sufficiently glorious for them, and for their brave leader, the Black
Prince.</p></div>

wish to represent the original completely, the poem being almost
untranslateable into English verse. Italian critics are much divided as
to its object. One of the most eminent (Bembo) considers it to be
nothing more than an unconnected string of proverbs.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
